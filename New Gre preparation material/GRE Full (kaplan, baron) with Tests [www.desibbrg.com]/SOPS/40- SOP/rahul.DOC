	Statement of Purpose
}
\end{center}

My aspiration to work at the frontiers of Scientific research leads me 
to apply to your university. I believe that a comprehensive  knowledge 
and a good grasp of fundamentals are essential for such  a  career.  I 
feel that Graduate studies in Computer Science in a good  University  like 
yours will help me realize this objective. Therefore I am seeking
admission to the Ph.D.  program  at  
Harvard  with a specialization in  Computer  Science.  
I  have  compelling 
reasons to believe that I will  be  extremely  successful  both  as  a 
Graduate student and later as a researcher.

%As  a  first  step  towards 
%obtaining a Ph.D., I am seeking admission to the Master's  program  at 
%Harvard University with a specialization in  Computer  Science.  I  would 
%prefer doing a direct Ph.D., if it  is  possible.  I  have  compelling 

My superlative performance in school fetched me a number of awards at 
the national level. I was awarded the prestigious National Talent
Search Scholarship in class ten.
%and was in the top twenty five in the
%National Standard Examination in Physics in my twelfth.
I had developed a keen  interest  in  science  and 
decided to choose it  as  my  career.  I  therefore,  took  the  Joint 
Entrance Examination for admission to the  five  Indian  Institute  of 
Technologies, which are  considered  the  best  academic  centers  for 
science and Engineering in India and qualified  in  the  top  0.3\%  of 
those who took the test.

I have always adopted a rigorous approach in order to attain an in-depth 
understanding of the subject at  hand.  This  has  given  me  a  broad 
conceptual basis, which, I  believe,  is  essential  for  my  research 
career.  My  grades  in  the  basic  courses  reflect  my  quest   for 
fundamentals. My overall grades in my undergraduate studies have been good,
but not excellent. This again reflects my approach to courses more as
an introduction to concepts that need further independent study by the
student, rather than as a run-up to a semester-end examination.

Over the past two years in Computer Science I have developed a special 
interest in {\bf Programming Languages and Distributed \& Parallel  Systems.}
I have been involved in research in these areas and have  consistently 
obtained good grades in the related courses. In Spring' 95, I will  be 
taking two Graduate level courses in these fields namely  `Distributed 
Databases' and `Advanced Compilers'. I have written an  article  on 
``Distributed  File  Systems''  with  Prof.  M.R.  Bhujade  which appeared in  
the September 1994 issue of {\bf CSI (Computer Society of India)
Communications}. In this article  the  basic  concepts  underlying  the 
design and  implementation aspects  were  discussed  and  contemporary 
systems like Locus, Andrew and Unix United were surveyed in detail.

I am currently working on  ``Register  Allocation  Algorithms''  for  my 
B.Tech thesis under the guidance of Prof. D.M.Dhamdhere. In my  project 
we have introduced a  technique of live range confinement 
which adapts the live range of a data item to the availability of
register. Instead of splitting a live range like in a  Chow-Hennessy
allocator we are implementing the confinement technique. 
Half way through the project we have already sent part of our work for the 
{\bf ACM SIGPLAN'95
Conference} on {\bf Programming Language Design and Implementation}
sponsored by the {\bf Special Interest Group on Programming Languages,
Association for Computing Machinery.}

%I had also presented a course paper on language Linda  which  consists 
%of operators that embody tuple space model  for  Parallel  programming 
%and involves Distributed Data Structures.

I have a reason also to be  confident of my abilities as a teacher. As
part of a nation wide teaching program, I have taught school children
subjects like Physics, Mathematics and English for four semesters (three
hours per week). This was an interesting experience which I feel would
stand in good stead in the future.

I take immense pleasure in learning  new  concepts.  This  inquisitive 
nature of mine along-with a desire to realize my full  potential  drive 
me to pursue research. I am aware that  research  calls  for  complete 
dedication and commitment. I consider myself to be mature, perceptive, 
persistent and open  to  criticism %  qualities  which  I  believe  are 
%essential for group research.

%by working under the guidance of distinguished professors like Prof. A 
%b ffffffffffffff, whose  interests  match  closely  with  mine,  I  am 
%confident of making an original contribution to the field of  Computer 
%Science. 


I have studied in one of the best institutes of our country and feel
the need to expose myself to research in United States which is
currently a world leader in Computer Science.
I have chosen to pursue Graduate studies at Harvard University because 
the facilities at Harvard  seem to foster a healthy research
environment as I could gather from the brochure of your department.
I believe that I possess  the  motivation,  the  intellectual 
ability, and the preparation to  set  out  on  this  exhilarating  and 
arduous path, to do justice to a demanding Graduate program and to make 
significant contributions to the ongoing work at your University.

%I have chosen to pursue graduate studies at University of Maryland  because 
%by working under the guidance of distinguished professors like Prof. A 
%b ffffffffffffff, whose  interests  match  closely  with  mine,  I  am 
%confident of making an original contribution to the field of  Computer

I look forward to joining Harvard University as  a  Graduate  student  at 
your esteemed department.
