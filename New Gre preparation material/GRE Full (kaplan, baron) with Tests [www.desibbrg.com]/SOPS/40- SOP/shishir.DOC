{\bf \large Statement of Purpose} \\
\end{center}
\noindent
{\large {\bf Introduction}}\\
In this era of information technology I feel a sense of pride in being so
closely associated with the field of computer science. The desire to 
forge ahead in this field by doing cutting--edge research has motivated
me to pursue graduate studies.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Academic Background}}\\ 
I hail from a small industrial town where education is given a very
high priority. My father is an educator himself. This background
inculcated in me a deep inclination for academics from the very
beginning. The subjects that attracted me most were Mathematics and
Physics. In order to pursue a career in science and engineering, I
appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination for admission to
I.I.T.s. Securing an {\em All India Rank of $162$} amongst $100,000$
candidates ($99.8$ percentile), I joined I.I.T. Bombay, one of the
best institutes for engineering education in India. The growing
involvement of computers in various fields of science and technology
encouraged me to choose computer science as my branch of study in
undergraduate studies.\\

\noindent
{\large \bf {Undergraduate Studies}}\\
After coming to I. I. T., I was introduced to the true expanse of computer 
science. The core courses gave me an in--depth knowledge in each field. The 
lab courses and projects gave me the programming skills ( for details of 
the projects please refer resume ). Most of these projects were 
done in groups of two to four students. This gave me the opportunity to 
learn to work in a group -- both as a leader or otherwise.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Areas of Interest}}\\
My main objective during my undergraduate studies was to get an overview of 
various fields in computer science and identify a field of interest in which 
I could pursue my research career. Because of their vast applications, 
computer systems, in general, have attracted me. In particular, I am interested 
in databases, distributed systems and parallel processing. My Junior thesis 
was on {\em database mining}, which I completed under the guidance of 
\mbox{Dr. S. Seshadri}. I am currently doing 
work in {\em parallelizing compilers} as part of my Senior thesis 
under \mbox{Dr. S. Biswas}. I have also registered for a course on "models of 
parallel computation" , intended to deal with fundamentals of parallel 
algorithms and parallel architectures, in the forthcoming semester.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Career Objectives}}\\
Within a decade or so, I visualize myself as a full fledged research 
professional in an organization or a faculty member at one of the leading 
Universities. I see Ph.D as a first step in achieving this career objective. 
I am willing to do MS as an intermediate step.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Strengths}}\\
There are a few things whose value I realized during my undergraduate
studies and now I strongly believe in them. These are {\em hard work}
-- Necessity to produce results, {\em discipline} -- Necessity to finish 
task before deadlines and {\em persistence} -- Necessity to sail through 
unproductive periods. My attempt throughout has been to inculcate these 
qualities in myself in which, I believe, I have been fairly successful.\\
 
\noindent
{\large {\bf Weaknesses}}\\
A major weakness of mine has been my speed. I always try to attack a problem
in depth which invariably requires some amount of time. As a result, I have not
been able to perform very well in ``three hour'' exams. This weakness has been 
reflected in my grades. However, given sufficient time I have always been able
to show good results, reflected by the good grades (AA or AB) in 
lab courses involving projects.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Reasons for selecting Ohio State University }}\\
My advisors recommended me of  your university on the basis of faculty interests
and the research work currently in progress. After going through the brochure, I 
realized that there also exists a vast gamut of opportunities, especially 
excellent computing facilities , in your department. In addition, from the 
communication I had with Dr. Mukesh Singhal, I have to come to conclusion that the graduate
program at your department would suit my interests extremely well.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Conclusion}}\\
I am fully aware that a research career requires a constant, well--directed
and whole--hearted effort. I am confident that I would meet all the
above demands. Hence I appeal to the Graduate Admissions Committee to
consider me for admission, and financial aid.
