\begin{flushleft}
{\bf Academic \& Career Objectives}
\end{flushleft}

	My long term career goals include the pursuit of research in
the field of Theoretical Computer Science and teaching in an academic
environment. I have found that a career in research is both
intellectually stimulating and satisfying and hence I have decided to
take this up as my career objective.

\begin{flushleft}
{\bf Degree Objectives}
\end{flushleft}

	I want to work towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science in the
field of Theoretical Computer Science. My interests include both the
design and analysis of Algorithms as well as Computational Complexity Theory.

\begin{flushleft}
{\bf Reason for Graduate Work}
\end{flushleft}

	I have always been fascinated by mathematics. As a part of my
undergraduate curriculum, I have been exposed to a range of
advanced mathematical techniques and I have been especially drawn towards
both the analysis of Algorithms and Complexity Theory. These fields
have both a strong mathematical flavor as well as the potential for
research which is what attracts me towards them.

	The fact that these subjects form a unifying feature of all
fields in Computer Science and their quest towards achieving the limits
of what can and can't be done, form part of the reasons for my
fascination in them.

	An undergraduate degree is merely an exposure to the various
fields in any branch of higher education. I feel that my
undergraduate curriculum has given me a sufficient enough exposure to
all the various possibilities for research that are possible and I
have chosen the one for which I have both an aptitude as well as a liking.
%that I both have an aptitude for as well as a
%liking.

	In order to pursue an active career in research, it is
necessary to both study and understand the finer nuances of any
subject. I believe that Graduate Studies will not only provide me with
advanced knowledge about the field but also prepare me to be a good
researcher. It is precisely this reason which prompts me to take up
Graduate Studies as the next step towards my career objectives.

\newpage

	As an initial step towards achieving my goal, as part of my
undergraduate studies, I have chosen my electives so as to enhance my
understanding of these subjects. These include such subjects as
{\tt Design \& Analysis of Algorithms}, {\tt Combinatorics} and
{\tt Abstract Algebra I}. I have also audited (taken as non-credit)
a Graduate level course {\tt Algorithms \& Complexity}.
I have attended an Advanced Mathematics Training Programme in
Summer '93 so as to enhance my mathematical abilities.

{\bf Why have I chosen Stanford}
\end{flushleft}

	I have chosen Stanford as the place at which I would
like to pursue a doctoral degree because I find that the graduate
program is fully suited to my needs and that it possesses a strong
faculty in the field of Theoretical Computer Science.

        I have also consulted the professors in my university who are
working in the field of Algorithms and Complexity Theory and they have
strongly recommended the research work in these fields at Stanford.

        Hence, I have applied to Stanford so as to fulfill
both my academic as well as my career objectives.
