	My decision to apply for a {\bf Ph.D.} program at {\bf 
University of Utah} is driven by my aspirations to pursue a research career in
the field of Computer Science. This field interests me because of its
formal and rigorous mathematical nature and its wide-ranging
applications. I believe that a strong and thorough background as well
as complete awareness of recent developments are essential for an
intellectually stimulating and satisfying research career. Towards
realizing this objective at an esteemed department such as yours, I am
applying to your university. An objective analysis of my background,
interests, strengths and weaknesses leads me to believe that I will be
successful both as a Ph.D. candidate and later as a researcher in an
academic milieu. 

\

	Academics has always been my strong-hold. My inquisitive
nature and a strong desire to ingrain the fundamental principles as
well as techniques of any subject of study has enabled me to achieve
an excellent academic record. More importantly, it has inculcated in
me the methodology of scientific inquiry as reflected in my rigorous
and analytic approach to problem solving. This is further evident from
my performance at higher-secondary school level and at IIT Bombay. The
excellent course structure at IIT has given me a sound and broad
conceptual basis, which, I believe, is essential for a research
career. Through many projects I have undertaken in a stimulating
academic environment at IIT where learning and research go
hand-in-hand, I have found that I have a deep  interest in research
work, a strong motivation and an aptitude for the type of problem
solving it involves. 

\

	Over the past two years at IIT, I have cultivated a keen interest
in the field of {\bf Asynchronous Circuits, Formal Design Methods in VLSI}. I
have furthered my knowledge in this field by reading various related
articles and am actively involved in research in this area. I  have
also opted for a graduate level course {\bf IC Design Technology} in Spring
96. I am currently working on {\bf Asynchronous Communication between
Synchronous Finite State Machines} for my B.Tech. thesis under the
guidance of {\bf Prof. S. Ramesh}. I am working towards implementing
communication primitives such as {\bf rendezvous, probe} etc. at gate level
in VLSI circuits. I am investigating different interconnect design
methodologies which can be implemented as {\bf delay-insensitive
asynchronous circuits}. In the first stage of this work, we have
proposed a {\bf new protocol} to implement {\bf asynchronous rendezvous 
communication} and a method to implement this protocol using asynchronous 
circuits. I  firmly believe that this project is a sufficient 
demonstration of my ability to conduct original and independent 
research.  

\

	I have strong reasons to believe that I possess the
temperament for teaching, a good power of speech and a thorough and
extensive knowledge of my field : traits required for a successful
teaching career. I have worked as a teaching assistant in a
nation-wide teaching program for two years. I have also been lecturer
and tutor for three {\bf UNIX workshops} conducted by {\bf CSEA, IIT Bombay} 
which were attended by more than 250 people every time. This experience 
developed and honed my skills of organizing and communicating my thoughts 
in front of a responsive and critical audience. 

\

	I have always attempted to gain insight into the problem at hand
and tackle it from different angles. I am well aware that a career in
research calls for personal commitment and personal sacrifice of time,
leisure and immediate reward. However, my desire to realize my full
potential and to make an original contribution to the field of
Computer Science drive me to pursue a research career, which, I
believe, will give me intellectual satisfaction, gratification of
becoming a contributor to knowledge and personal rewards of learning
and discovery. I not only possess the intellectual ability, sound
preparation and the strong motivation for research but also consider
myself mature, friendly to work with and open to criticism : qualities
essential for group research. 

\

	I believe that a symbiotic relationship between the student
and his department is of utmost importance for a successful graduate
program. Considering the pioneering work going on at your department
in the field of my interest, your department is an ideal choice for an
exciting research career. At the same time, I am confident of
contributing originally to the ongoing work at your department. By
working under the guidance of distinguished faculty at your
department, I am sure, I will be able to exploit my potential to the
fullest.

\

	Keeping this in mind, I look forward to joining {\bf  
University of Utah}.
