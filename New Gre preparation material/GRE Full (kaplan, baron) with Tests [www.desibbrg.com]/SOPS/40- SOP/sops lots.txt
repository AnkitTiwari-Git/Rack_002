    Statement of Purpose

	I am applying to Stanford University for admission 
to the Ph.D. program in Computer Science. I am interested in
Theoretical Computer Science, particularly in the Design
and Analysis of Approximation Algorithms, Combinatorics and
Complexity Theory.

	My interest in Mathematics goes back to the time I
was at school. This interest has only grown through my years
in school and high school, as I have learnt more and more about
the subject. Having represented India at the International
Mathematical Olympiads on two occasions, I have been exposed
to elements of Discrete Mathematics, particularly Combinatorics
and Graph Theory, outside the regular school curriculum at 
an early stage. The intensive training programs we were put 
through for the Olympiads have given me a lot of confidence in 
dealing with abstract mathematical problems.
	
	My exposure to Computer Science began after 
I entered the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay.
The excellent facilities, courses and faculty have given me a
firm background of the fundamentals in Computer Science.
Having been exposed to the various facets of Computer Science
in the course of my undergraduate studies, I have found 
Theoretical Computer Science most intellectually satisfying 
and stimulating. Courses like `Discrete Structures', 
`Data Structures and Algorithms', `Theory of Computation' and
`Algorithms and Complexity' have been my firm favorites.
I find the problems in Theoretical Computer Science particularly
appealing because of the flavor of abstract mathematics that
I love so much. At the same time, the problems in this field
have a concrete basis, originating from practical problems in
Computer Science. This adds to their appeal.

	Recently, a lot of exciting developments have taken place in the 
field of approximation algorithms. The Markov chain approach and the
primal/dual approach have emerged as powerful techniques for the 
development of approximation algorithms. More recently, semi-definite 
programming has been used to obtain approximation algorithms for 
optimization problems.  An interesting connection with results in 
Interactive Proof Systems has yielded lower bounds on the approximability 
of various problems. I believe that these methods have a lot of 
potential. A lot of the pioneering work in these areas has been done 
by members of the faculty at Stanford. Prof. Rajeev Motwani has been 
involved in the work on Interactive Proof Systems and semi-definite 
programming.  I have read about these results in the course of my 
seminar (Junior Thesis), my summer training at the Tata Institute 
of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay, and my B.Tech. project 
(Senior Thesis). I find them very fascinating and intend to work 
with problems of a similar flavor.

	I am convinced that I should pursue a career in research and teaching.
For me, problem solving is an exhilarating experience, unequaled
by anything else. It would be immensely gratifying for me to be
able to contribute something to the understanding of a subject that 
has given me so much pleasure and joy. It would also be wonderful to 
have the opportunity to share with others that feeling of pleasure and 
joy, through teaching.  My few experiences with teaching, as a tutor 
for an undergraduate course and as a lecturer in student workshops, 
have evoked favorable responses and have been thoroughly enjoyable.
I believe that I have the capacity to make the commitment and 
accept the challenges that a career in research involves. I am 
confident that I have the requisite aptitude, exposure and motivation 
to make a meaningful contribution to my chosen field.

	My summer training at TIFR has given me the experience of 
working in an organization oriented towards research. In the course
of the two months I spent there, my interaction with the Theoretical 
Computer Science group has taught me a lot of things and also whet
my appetite for more knowledge. I realize how important it is, as a
researcher, to interact with other people working in the same field,
and at the same time, be able to work individually.

	A good research career can only be built above the firm foundation 
of a good education. With my long term goal in mind, my immediate
objective is to work towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science. Having done
my undergraduate studies at undoubtedly one of the best undergraduate
institutions in India, I would consider it my privilege to be able to
pursue my doctoral studies at Stanford University and avail of the
excellent infrastructural facilities and research opportunities it has
to offer. I am sure that the stimulating academic environment and 
interaction with the distinguished faculty at Stanford will prove 
immensely fruitful and facilitate my development as an individual 
researcher in my field. I feel that Stanford has a lot to offer me,
and at the same time, I am confident that I would be able to make a 
positive contribution to on-going research work at Stanford.

	Having decided that I will engage in the pursuit of a career in 
research, I am fully aware of the implications. I am aware of the
kind of dedication, resilience and resolve that it calls for. I feel
that I am adequately prepared, both in having the technical 
qualifications, and in having the right mind-set for doctoral level
research work. I look forward to a long and mutually beneficial 
relationship with Stanford University.

                Statement of Purpose

My objective for graduate  studies  in  Computer  Science  is  to
prepare  myself  for  the  long term goal of pursuing a career of
teaching and research. 
I have  nurtured  a  strong  passion  to
become  a  scientist  and  pursue  research.  In  the  pursuit of
knowledge , I have always adopted a rigorous approach in order to
attain  an in-depth understanding of the subject at hand.This has
amply  reflected  in  my  consistently  brilliant   career,always
topping  the  class  and  having received numerous national level
awards.With a GPA of 9.72 , I am ranked first at  the  IIT  among
nearly 350 students. 


I have been involved in  research  in  parallel  and  distributed
computing  systems.I  studied  various  problems  in  distributed
systems and distributed databases  including  deadlock  detection
and  resolution  ,  termination detection , distributed snapshots
and consistency.I  have  been  attracted  towards  the  field  of
correctness  of parallel programs. I published a Technical Report
reporting errors in two published deadlock  detection  algorithms
and  highlights their underlying deficiencies with respect to the
distributed nature of computation.  I am  also  involved  in  the
development  of  an  optimizer generator which would automate the
process of writing optimizers based on the specifications of  the
optimizations.I  am  currently  engaged  in writing a paper on an
efficient algorithm for performing global data-flow analysis. The
new  algorithm  that  I  have  developed  utilizes  the notion of
backward information flow to perform propagation using work-lists
in  an  efficient  manner.  I  have  been  in correspondence with
Professor J.D.Ullman about my algorithm and other aspects of  the
problem.


I have chosen to pursue graduate studies at  Stanford  University
because  by  working  under  the  guidance  of  the distinguished
researchers I am confident of making an original contribution  in
the  field  of  Computer  Science.  My  interest  in research has
burgeoned during my undergraduate studies at IIT. I have excelled
in  our  the well-rounded  and exacting undergraduate program and
have developed a solid background to take up research in Computer
Science.             

I have decided to go in for graduate studies which  calls  for  a
personal  commitment   to  the  fulfilling  craft  of independent
research and that involves willingly making  personal  sacrifices
of time , leisure and immediate reward  .  In  turn  I shall  get
intellectual  satisfaction  and  the gratification of becoming  a
contributor  to   knowledge   through  research  and  the greater
personal rewards of  learning  and  discovery.I  believe  that  I
possess  the  motivation, intellectual ability and preparation to
set  out  on  this  exhiliarating  and  arduous  path and to make
significant original  contributions  to  your  on-going  research
work.


I look  forward  to  joining Stanford University as  a  graduate
student at your esteemed department.

%	GOALS-SECTION

I, {\bf Amit Chakrabarti}, am applying to Princeton University for admission to
the {\bf Ph.D. program} in {\bf Computer Science}. My research interests lie
in the field of {\bf Theoretical Computer Science}. More specifically, I am
interested in the Design and Analysis of Algebraic, Combinatorial and Number
Theoretic Algorithms as well as their applications. Other areas that interest
me are Theory of Computation, Complexity Theory and Geometric Algorithms.

My long-term goal is to be actively involved with research and teaching in an
area that I love. I look forward to such an involvement as a faculty member at
a reputed university. A Ph.D. in one of the aforementioned areas would be the
crucial first step towards this goal.

%	PERSONAL-BACKGROUND-SECTION

\subsection*{\sc Personal background}
Both my parents have done their Ph.D.'s in Mathematics and my father is an
active researcher in Applied Mathematics. This had inculcated in me a love for
Mathematics right from my school days. On the other hand, I entered school in
the same year in which the ``personal computer revolution'' began in India;
therefore I have, in some sense, ``grown up with computers''. My interest in
Theoretical Computer Science is the combined result of these two influences.

%	MATHS-BACKGROUND-SECTION

\subsection*{\sc Mathematical background}
While in high school, I was involved with the Mathematical Olympiad program
and this culminated in my being awarded a silver medal at the 34th
International Mathematical Olympiad. As a result of this involvement, I was
exposed to basic Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Number Theory at an early
age. Moreover, the intensive training-cum-selection program I underwent has
honed my skills and bolstered my confidence in problem solving. It has also
whetted my appetite for problem solving and made me a regular reader of the
problem sections of periodicals like {\em American Mathematical Monthly} and
{\em Mathematics Magazine}.

I was chosen, by the National Board of Higher Mathematics, as one of 18
undergraduates all over India to participate in their nurture program, in
parallel with my formal undergraduate training. The resulting three-year-long
interaction with the School of Mathematics of the prestigious Tata Institute
of Fundamental Research (TIFR), has given me a substantial background in
advanced mathematics (including Group, Ring and Field Theory, Linear Algebra,
Real and Complex Analysis, Measure Theory and Topology). As part of this
year's program, I am studying Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Number Theory and
Functional Analysis.

I hope to put my mathematical background to good use in my research work.

%	CS-BACKGROUND-SECTION

\subsection*{\sc Computer Science background}
I am currently a senior undergraduate student of the Indian Institute of
Technology (IIT), Bombay, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I had
chosen this department for its academically stimulating atmosphere, excellent
faculty and broad spectrum of courses, many of which have a strong
mathematical flavor.

Now, having acquired a firm foundation in the various areas of Computer
Science, I am sure that my forte is Theoretical Computer Science. I find that
my motivation, as well as my aptitude, is the strongest in this field: I have
secured the highest possible grade (AA) in all the five theory courses that I
have taken at IIT Bombay, namely, {\em Discrete Structures, Data Structures
and Algorithms, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Theory of Computation} and
{\em Operations Research}.

I have further enhanced my Theory background by opting for theoretical topics
in my {\em Seminar} (junior thesis) and my {\em B.Tech.\ Project} (senior
thesis). The former involved studies in Commutative Algebra and Computational
Algebra, while the latter has involved Combinatorial Algorithms, Graph Theory
and Randomized Algorithms and will soon involve Approximation Algorithms and
applications of graph partitioning to VLSI design.

%	RESEARCH-PLANS-SECTION

\subsection*{\sc Research plans}
I find Algorithms and Complexity theory the most appealing areas of Computer
Science because of their many beautiful results together with their numerous
applications to real-life problems in Databases, Operating Systems, Graphics,
Compilers and so on. I am fascinated with the enormous potential for research
in these areas which has been revealed to me in my {\em Seminar} and {\em
B.Tech.\ project} and that is what I envisage myself doing a decade from now.

Since problem solving is the most enjoyable and rewarding experience I have
ever known, and since it is an integral part of a career in research and
teaching in Theoretical Computer Science, I am convinced that such a career is
the right choice for me. I am eager to contribute something to a subject that
has given me so much joy. I am also enthusiastic about being involved in its
teaching, as teaching a subject enhances one's own understanding of it.

%	WHY-THIS-UNIV-SECTION

\subsection*{\sc Choosing Princeton}
Princeton University has one of the world's very best Theoretical Computer
Science groups. An opportunity to interact with this group would be a golden
one for any budding theoretician.

>From a careful study of the department's brochures and the advice of the
faculty at IIT Bombay, I have realized that Princeton can provide me with a
perfect environment for directing my mental resources towards independent
research. I am confident of meeting the high standards of Princeton; my active
involvement and enthusiasm in my undergraduate studies, which is amply
reflected in my being ranked {\bf first in the institute}, should serve as
proof of my possessing the necessary qualities.

%	CONCLUDING-SECTION

\subsection*{\sc Conclusion}
Keeping in mind my long-term goals, my immediate objective is to work towards
a Ph.D. in Computer Science. I am aware of the kind of dedication,
perseverance and resolve I need to have for a fruitful career in research and
teaching. I believe my background has not only qualified me technically but
also given me the right mind-set for such a career.

\ 

I have excelled in academics at every stage of my education. In the
twelve years of my schooling, I have always been ranked first or second in
my class. I stood  $111^{th}$ out of 100,000 candidates in the
highly competitive examination for admission to the undergraduate
program at the Indian Institutes of Technology. In the Regional
Mathematics Olympiad 1990, I was ranked $6^{th}$ in my home
state of Maharashtra.

\

The excellent undergraduate program at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Bombay not only provided me with a strong foundation of
Computer Science fundamentals, but also exposed me to various fields
of Computer Science. I have always been interested in problems
involving visualization. At IIT, this led to an inclination towards
Computer Graphics and Computational Geometry. I substantiated my
knowledge in these areas by choosing graduate level electives in
Advanced Computer Graphics and Geometric Algorithms. I am currently
working on my year long B.Tech Project (senior thesis) titled {\em
Triangulations in 3 Dimensions}, under the guidance of Dr. Sharat
Chandran. In this thesis we are looking at decompostions of polyhedra
into simplices with an emphasis on obtaining well shaped tetrahedra.

 \

%%% Seminar
I am also interested in Multimedia technology. In my third year, I
presented a home paper titled {\em Multimedia Databases} under the
guidance of Dr. S. Seshadri. In this paper, our study was focussed on
issues involved in the storage and real time retrieval of multimedia
objects in a multi-user environment.

Professor


Dear Professor,

	I am a final (fourth) year Bachelor of Technology student
of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of
Technology (I. I. T.), Bombay. I am keen on joining the Graduate
program (MS / PhD, preferably PhD) at your University, and have
received the application materials. I have made a keen perusal of
the technical brochure provided along with the application form,
and have noted that your research interests concur with my areas of
interest, which are :

	(1) Artificial Intelligence, specifically Learning and
	    Natural Language Processing.
	(2) Neural networks and neural modeling.

	Sir, I am writing to you because I wish to have some more
specific information regarding the research activities in these
fields at your University, and my chances of admission to the
Graduate program at your University. I would be grateful if you
could spare some time in evaluating my credentials, which I have
summarized below (I have also enclosed a copy of the bio-data form
which I had earlier sent to your University) :

	I am doing my undergraduate study at I. I. T. Bombay, one
of the premier institutes of advanced technical education in India.
I have maintained a consistent Grade Point Average, my Cumulative
Performance Index being 8.43 (on a scale of 10).

	My credit seminar (junior thesis) was on "Human and
Artificial Intelligence". I concentrated on some aspects of
intelligence, especially Knowledge Representation, Memory, and
Learning, both from the human and the computer perspective. It
involved an extensive literature survey, and a presentation at the
end.

	My final-year project (senior thesis) is on "Word
Recognition and Spell Checking using ART-based Neural Networks".
Working under the Adaptive Resonance Theory paradigm (developed by
Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter), a neural network is to be
trained to recognize English words, and make intelligent
suggestions in case of spelling or grammatical mistakes. We are
also studying other models of learning for this purpose. My guide
is Professor Pushpak Bhattacharya.

	As my financial resources are limited, I would be
requesting financial aid from your Department or University, in the
form of TA / RA / Fellowship. I have some teaching experience, as I
am a course assistant for a Fresher course, "Computer Programming
and Utilization". This involves engaging weekly tutorial classes,
evaluating term papers, programming assignments, etc.

	Sir, I would be extremely grateful if you would devote some
of your valuable time in making a frank appraisal of my chances of
gaining admission to your University with full financial aid. I
would really like to work under your guidance for my post-graduate
studies. I shall be eagerly awaiting your reply.

	Thanking you,

				Yours Sincerely,
				Vinay Gupta

                         STATEMENT  OF  PURPOSE
                        ------------------------
It is after a good deal of self-evaluation that I have decided to pursue 
graduate studies in Computer Science leading to a doctorate. This decision
followed naturally after carefully considering my academic background,
the areas of my interest, and my ultimate professional ambition, which is to
pursue a research career, either as a teaching faculty member, or in an 
R & D department of the industry.

My undergraduate education at IIT Bombay has provided me with a strong 
and comprehensive background in Computer Science. The curriculum included
all the  basic courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete

a student into a largely independent researcher making significant original
contributions.  Secondly, the emphasis of graduate study on intensive and

record, and my high GRE scores are testimony to that.
I, therefore, look forward to joining your department as a graduate student.

                        ------------------------
It is after a good deal of self-evaluation that I have decided to pursue 
graduate studies in Computer Science leading to a doctorate. This decision
followed naturally after carefully considering my academic background,
the areas of my interest, and my ultimate professional ambition, which is to
pursue a research career, either as a teaching faculty member, or in an 
R & D department of the industry.

My undergraduate education at IIT Bombay has provided me with a strong 
and comprehensive background in Computer Science. The curriculum included
all the  basic courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete 
Structures, Computer Organization and Design, Systems Programming, Theory of
Computation, etc.

I had always been fascinated by the field of Artificial Intelligence, which
is why I chose the topic of "Human and Artificial Intelligence" for my junior

\begin{center}	{\Large \bf Statement of Purpose}  \end{center}

\subsubsection*{My Long Term Goals}
My undergraduate training in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay,
has exposed me to a stimulating academic environment where learning and research go hand--in--hand. Through the many
opportunities I have had here, I have found that I have a deep interest in research work and a strong aptitude for the
type of problem solving and problem discovery that it involves. I have, therefore, decided to pursue active research in
Computer Science as a career.

\subsubsection*{My Areas of Interest}
Of the many fields in the Computer Science spectrum, I am especially interested in Computer Systems. Within this field,
I am interested in 
computer networks, distributed systems, operating systems and distributed operating systems. My junior seminar work,
my practical training and my courses have given me plenty of exposure to these areas and I feel that I have sufficient
motivation and aptitude to work in this field.

I am also interested in Programming Language design and Programming Systems. I have worked in these areas in my 
summer project at TIFR and in my ongoing B. Tech. project. I would like to continue to learn about these areas in 
my graduate program.
 
\subsubsection*{My Immediate Goals}
I plan to work towards a Ph. D. program with a focus on Distributed and Parallel Operating Systems. I would also like to follow up my interests
in Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, Operating Systems and Programming Languages through my course work. I feel that this should be my 
next step on my road to a research career in Computer Science.

\subsubsection*{Why Duke?}
I have selected Duke as the place for me to continue with my education because I found that the Graduate Program in 
Computer Science suited my needs perfectly. I have found the Duke Computer Science Department faculty and the research
being carried out in Computer Systems, especially in Distributed Operating Systems, to be very impressive.
I feel that to be associated with this group for the many years of my Ph. D. would stand me in good stead for my research
career. I have also been impressed by the computing facilities available at Duke for research and education. These are
much superior to those available to a graduate student in India. Taking all these factors into  account, I feel that
Duke is the perfect place for my graduate studies and I am confident that I will make a positive contribution to the
ongoing research work at Duke.

\subsubsection*{Am I Prepared?}
My undergraduate preparation at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay,
has given me a very substantial knowledge of the basic areas of Computer Science. Through my junior seminar work, I have acquired a good knowledge
of distributed operating systems and the problems they entail. It also exposed me to the broad
fields of computer networks, distributed systems and operating systems. I have also been exposed to practical 
computer networks and network programming in the course of my practical training at the State Bank of India, Head Office.
My course projects have given me plenty of experience in programming using various programming languages, software 
packages and operating systems. I have selected {\em Introduction to Computer Networks} as an elective course in 
the seventh semester so as to broaden my knowledge in this area. Therefore, I feel confident that I have acquired 
both a broad base in Computer Science and a strong foundation in Computer Systems.

\subsubsection*{Summing Up}
I am aware of the hard work and perseverence necessary for research work and I know that it is not always as exciting as
the published results seem to indicate. Nevertheless, I am sure that my aptitude and drive will see me through the 
challenge. I hope to have a long and mutually profitable association with Duke.

%\section*{Introduction}

I, Rahul Thombre, am a senior student of the Bachelor of Technology program
in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology,
Bombay. I am applying for graduate studies in Computer Science leading to a
Ph.D. I see this as a first step towards achieving my career objective of
research in an academic environment. 
%
%\section*{Academic Background}

I have excelled in academics right from my school days. In school, I
consistently used to secure one of the top positions in the class.
In my twelfth standard examinations, I was placed in the merit position at
an All India level. I have always been attracted towards subjects that
draw upon one's  analytical abilities. Thus, Mathematics and Physics were
my favorite subjects. I was placed among the top 1\% of the candidates who
appeared for the National Search Examination in Physics all over
India. Later, I secured the 97$^{\mbox{th}}$ position among the 80,000
candidates who appeared throughout India for the Joint Entrance Examination. 
This examination is conducted by the IIT's, the premier engineering
institutions of India, for selecting the best of Indian talent.
%
%\section*{Computer Science Background}

The undergraduate program at IIT aims to strike a balance between the
theoretical as well as the practical aspects of Computer Science. This has
given me a sound understanding of the fundamentals at both the theoretical
as well as practical levels.

I have performed reasonably well in my undergraduate courses at IIT, but
since IIT admits only the best students throughout the country, I 
believe, in view of the competitive atmosphere, that the grades secured
should not be considered in an absolute sense.

During the course of the B.Tech. program I have developed a keen interest
in the fields of Computer Graphics, Algorithms and Operating
Systems. At present I am working under the guidance of Dr.\ Sharat Chandran 
on my home paper titled {\em Physically Based Modeling}. As a junior, I had
presented a seminar on {\em Associative--Commutative Matching and
Unification}. I have included a brief summary of both these separately.
%
%\section*{Purpose of Doctoral Study and Career Goals}

During the course of my education at IIT,  I  have  realized  and
felt  convinced that my true liking and aptitude lies in research
and teaching. Research and teaching go  hand  in  hand.  Teaching
gives one a sense of constructive participation in the education
process. Research enables a person to  stay  in  touch  with  the
latest  advances,  while  making  one's  own contributions to the
field. I have also had a good deal of teaching experience as an 
undergraduate teaching assistant during my junior year for the freshman
course {\em Computer Programming and Utilization}. I have included a brief
description of this and relevant certificates to substantiate my claim.

I believe that graduate education is not merely a continuation of
college  studies.  I think that  graduate  education  is  process,  in
which the student learns how to do independent research. 

My decision to apply to UNIV is based on a careful examination of
the department bulletin and the research interests of the faculty
members. I have contacted PROF, who has encouraged me to apply.
I would really love working under his guidance for my Ph.D.
I believe that graduate education at your University will enhance
my  knowledge,  give me wide exposure and develop my abilities to
do independent research. I  consider  myself  an enthusiastic and 
hardworking person, and I am sure that my stay your university will be a 
very fruitful one.

{\Large {\bf My goals}}\\
I am applying to the PhD program in Computer Science at Brown University.
After considering my aptitude and the 
 type of work that I enjoy most, I am convinced that
I want to take up a career in research in Computer Science.
A PhD is just one step towards realising this goal.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My preparation for the same}}\\
My formal introduction to Computer Science began at IIT-Bombay. Under
its excellent faculty, I got exposed to  the entire spectrum of
Computer Science. In an environment that is intensely competitive, and where
research goes hand-in-hand with learning, I also got a lot of drill in
both theoretical research work and implementation, thus laying a sound
foundation for graduate study.

My academic and co-curriculur record has been consistently good. Throughout
school as well as now, I have been at or near the top of my class. I have
listed some of my achievements, on the attached resum\'{e}.
What I would like to stress most  however is the fact that I have been
{\em consistent} in {\em all} academic or co-curriculur (and even 
extracurriculur) tasks that I have undertaken.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My primary interests}}\\
 I have always loved problems which
 involve plenty of visualisation. At IIT, this resulted in
 an inclination towards {\bf Computer Graphics} and 
{\bf Computational Geometry}, and also Algorithms.
 {\em These are the subjects that I
want to pursue in my graduate study}.

I chose the elective {\em
Computer Graphics} and a graduate level course {\em Algorithms and
Complexity} this semester, in line with these interests. My B.Tech. Project
 (home paper), under {\bf Dr.Sharat Chandran},
is on {\bf Visible Surface Determination} (hidden surface removal), a very
popular topic in Computational Geometry.


\ \\
{\Large {\bf Why Brown University ?}}\\
It would be a clich\'{e} to say that all fields in 
Computer Science are highly interlinked.
 I have  experienced this myself, since frequently, while working on a
problem in one field, I have (through abstraction/ reduction/ analogy)
landed up looking at another problem, that one would normally put under
a different field altogether.

Hence, two criteria that I considered while selecting a university
for my Ph.D. were
\begin{enumerate}
\item the university must be very strong in {\bf Computational Geometry} 
and/or {\bf Computer Graphics} (my primary interests), and
\item it must be fairly good, if not exceptional, in other fields of
Computer Science too (especially, algorithms and combinatorics).
\end{enumerate}
Brown University more than satisfies these criteria. My B.Tech.
Project guide,
Dr.Sharat Chandran also strongly recommended it. An added attraction is
its participation in the
Science and Technology Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific 
Visualisation.

There is one more ({\em and the most compelling}) reason.
In my B.Tech. Project, my guide and I are
 concentrating on developing better methods 
for the moving/ multiple viewpoint case of hidden 
surface removal. The preliminary
 ideas that have emerged out of this effort use a
result on {\em Dynamic planar point location} by
{\bf Prof.Roberto Tamassia}. The {\em line sweep} technique is the other
major component in these ideas, and it was from {\bf Prof.Preparata}'s 
book on Computational Geometry, that I first learnt it.
 {\em The fact that  both are from Brown University
 convinced me that  Brown University is the natural
choice in realising my graduate goals.}
 Subsequently I  corresponded with Prof.Tamassia, and his
encouraging reply reinforced my decision to apply to Brown.

It would be a pleasure to continue my current research focus at Brown under
their supervision. At the same time, I am sure that many other problems which
the Brown CS department is currently focussing on, would be equally 
interesting to work on.


\ \\
{\Large {\bf What I plan to do at Brown}}\\
I plan to carry on advanced study of both Computer Graphics and 
Computational Geometry, as well as related fields (e.g. algorithms),
not only through coursework but also by
 {\em participating in one of the several ongoing projects}.
This will also give me the opportunity to
  contribute my bit to the understanding of the fields which interest me
so much.

 I am keen that 
the output of my PhD (and in fact, any PhD),
be well worth the time and effort spent on it. For the reasons mentioned
above, I am sure that Brown University
will provide me the right environment for this. 

\ \\
{\Large {\bf Financial Aid}}\\
I would be fully dependent on aid to finance my graduate studies.
 If I am granted an assistantship, then given my long term goals, 
a research assistantship would be
an ideal experience for me. I also have some experience as a teaching 
assistant. Not only have I enjoyed it, but the students have also appreciated
it. This makes me confident that I will be a good teacher also.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf In conclusion...}}\\
I am aware that Brown University expects very high standards from its students.
On my part, I can assure you of hard work. I believe that my enthusiasm will 
enable me to meet those expectations. My consistency in all previous academic
and co-curriculur activities is what gives me confidence when I say this.

Eagerly looking forward to a long and mutually profitable 
association with the Computer Science
department of Brown University,

{\large \bf Personal Statement}
\end{center}

\

My early fascination for computers (since high school), combined with
a strong liking for analytical subjects inspired me to seek admission
to one of the best and most competitive Computer Science undergraduate
programs in India --- the B.Tech program in IIT Bombay. I was
succesful in this endeavour, being ranked 113th among around 100,000
students in the entrance exams to the IITs. In IIT, a very strong
curriculum, introduced me to a wide range of subjects in Computer
Science, with a strong emphasis on theoretical fundamentals.  I have
always believed that a subject is understood better when one actually
sees an abstract theory being realized by a practical system. The
various demanding laboratory courses and projects in the B.Tech
program at IIT, have provided me with a better understanding of
Computer Science.  This belief has led to my growing interest in
computer systems, and I have consistently performed well in my
laboratory courses. I have also, as part of a campus wide systems
support group, been involved in compiling and installing various
software and systems.

\

Given these practical interests, my theoretical background, my
aptitude and academic potential for graduate study (indicated by my
GRE General score of (V 700, Q 790, A 780) and Computer Science
Subject score in the 98th percentile), I feel that pursuing a PhD
degree in Computer Science is a step in the right direction towards my
long term career goals.

\

Thirty years from now, I want to be able to look back at the
accomplishments of my life and feel a sense of satisfaction.
Satisfaction, because my work made a significant impact in my field.
And if I can achieve this goal I will consider my career a
success. Over the past four years, I have become absolutely convinced
that the path towards this goal will involve leveraging my current
skills and abilities to make significant contributions to improve the
understanding of systems and concepts in the field of Computer
Science. Six or seven years from now, I see myself as part of a
leading research group, contributing my bit to the field of Computer
Science. A PhD in Computer Science, is therefore a natural first step
towards this goal.

\

I plan to work towards a PhD in the field of {\bf Distributed Systems
and Networking}. I have become interested in this area during the
course of my undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay, through a series of
research and project experiences.

\

In my junior year, I presented a home paper on ``Wormhole Routing in
Interconnection Networks.''  Currently, I am in the midst of my year
long B.Tech thesis, titled ``Distribution Strategies for the
Satisfiability Problem,'' guided by Prof. G. Sivakumar (PhD,
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign).  For this thesis, I am
writing a distributed solution for the satisfiability problem, on a
network of workstations. My work will involve studying various
distributed computing techniques and writing a distributed version of
existing sequential solutions to satisfiability. Moreover, this
semester I have undertaken as an Operating Systems course project, a
study of implementation issues in ``Group Communication in the {\em
Amoeba} Distributed Operating System'' and will be crediting a
Postgraduate elective --- ``Foundations of Parallel Computation'' in
my final (next) semester.

\

In my opinion, the effective communication of ideas is an important
part of any research career.  During my undergraduate years in IIT, I
have been fortunate to have had some experience in teaching basic
Computer Science.  In my junior year, I was a teaching assistant for
an institute level introductory course in programming, ``CS 101:
Computer Programming and Utilization,'' for freshmen. The work
involved conducting tutorials, grading assignments, and providing
assistance during practical sessions.

\

In my junior and senior years, I have been the Technical Coordinator,
and subsequently General Seceratary of the Computer Science and
Engineering Association, IIT Bombay. In this capacity, I have been
actively involved in planning, organizing and lecturing at, various
workshops on UNIX aimed at both technical and lay audiences.  These
experiences have been extremely rewarding, and I am sure they will
help me in any teaching duties as a graduate student, and later on in 
my career.

\

I am confident that my strong motivation, my undergraduate experiences
and my analytical aptitude will help me to measure up to the rigours
of graduate study. I am looking forward to make my contributions to
the research going on at Dartmouth.

{\bf \large Statement of Purpose} \\
\end{center}
\noindent
{\large {\bf Introduction}}\\
In this era of information technology I feel a sense of pride in being so
closely associated with the field of computer science. The desire to 
forge ahead in this field by doing cutting--edge research has motivated
me to pursue graduate studies.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Academic Background}}\\ 
I hail from a small industrial town where education is given a very
high priority. My father is an educator himself. This background
inculcated in me a deep inclination for academics from the very
beginning. The subjects that attracted me most were Mathematics and
Physics. In order to pursue a career in science and engineering, I
appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination for admission to
I.I.T.s. Securing an {\em All India Rank of $162$} amongst $100,000$
candidates ($99.8$ percentile), I joined I.I.T. Bombay, one of the
best institutes for engineering education in India. The growing
involvement of computers in various fields of science and technology
encouraged me to choose computer science as my branch of study in
undergraduate studies.\\

\noindent
{\large \bf {Undergraduate Studies}}\\
After coming to I. I. T., I was introduced to the true expanse of computer 
science. The core courses gave me an in--depth knowledge in each field. The 
lab courses and projects gave me the programming skills ( for details of 
the projects please refer resume ). Most of these projects were 
done in groups of two to four students. This gave me the opportunity to 
learn to work in a group -- both as a leader or otherwise.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Areas of Interest}}\\
My main objective during my undergraduate studies was to get an overview of 
various fields in computer science and identify a field of interest in which 
I could pursue my research career. Because of their vast applications, 
computer systems, in general, have attracted me. In particular, I am interested 
in databases, distributed systems and parallel processing. My Junior thesis 
was on {\em database mining}, which I completed under the guidance of 
\mbox{Dr. S. Seshadri}. I am currently doing 
work in {\em parallelizing compilers} as part of my Senior thesis 
under \mbox{Dr. S. Biswas}. I have also registered for a course on "models of 
parallel computation" , intended to deal with fundamentals of parallel 
algorithms and parallel architectures, in the forthcoming semester.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Career Objectives}}\\
Within a decade or so, I visualize myself as a full fledged research 
professional in an organization or a faculty member at one of the leading 
Universities. I see Ph.D as a first step in achieving this career objective. 
I am willing to do MS as an intermediate step.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Strengths}}\\
There are a few things whose value I realized during my undergraduate
studies and now I strongly believe in them. These are {\em hard work}
-- Necessity to produce results, {\em discipline} -- Necessity to finish 
task before deadlines and {\em persistence} -- Necessity to sail through 
unproductive periods. My attempt throughout has been to inculcate these 
qualities in myself in which, I believe, I have been fairly successful.\\
 
\noindent
{\large {\bf Weaknesses}}\\
A major weakness of mine has been my speed. I always try to attack a problem
in depth which invariably requires some amount of time. As a result, I have not
been able to perform very well in ``three hour'' exams. This weakness has been 
reflected in my grades. However, given sufficient time I have always been able
to show good results, reflected by the good grades (AA or AB) in 
lab courses involving projects.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Reasons for selecting Ohio State University }}\\
My advisors recommended me of  your university on the basis of faculty interests
and the research work currently in progress. After going through the brochure, I 
realized that there also exists a vast gamut of opportunities, especially 
excellent computing facilities , in your department. In addition, from the 
communication I had with Dr. Mukesh Singhal, I have to come to conclusion that the graduate
program at your department would suit my interests extremely well.\\

\noindent
{\large {\bf Conclusion}}\\
I am fully aware that a research career requires a constant, well--directed
and whole--hearted effort. I am confident that I would meet all the
above demands. Hence I appeal to the Graduate Admissions Committee to
consider me for admission, and financial aid.

	Statement of Purpose
}
\end{center}


 I, Punit Bhargava, am a final year student of the four year Bachelor 
of Techonology (B.Tech.) program in Computer Science \& Engineering at 
the Indian Institute Of Techonology (IIT),  one of the nation's 
premier institutes. My long term career objective is to pursue a 
research career, either as a faculty in a university or a researcher in
industry and Graduate Study at your department would be the  first step towards this
goal.


  Since childhood I have had a strong inclination towards science. My excellent performance in academics inspired me to take up science as a career. 
I therefore, took the  Joint  Entrance  Examination  for   admission to 
the IITs and qualified in  the  top 0.12% of about 150,000 who took the 
test.

%I
           The excellent course structure coupled  with  high academic 
standard further stimulated my interest in scientific pursuit. My 
approach  towards  courses  was  to  grasp the basic concepts so as to 
develop a 'feel' for the subject. My grades reflect my attitude towards
courses. As a part  of  curriculum  I  actively  participated  in many 
innovative projects. As a result I have developed a keen interest and  have a sufficient aptitude for 
research and therefore I believe that I shall be  capable of meeting the best standards in research. 

%Interest
Over  the  past  two  years  in  the  Computer Science 
department, I have developed a keen  interest in  Programming Languages
and Distributed \& Parallel Systems. I have taken many courses related 
to this  field and have done cosistantly well in them. Courses such as
 Programming Languages, Language Processors (Compilers), Operating 
Systems 
have given me considerable exposure to this field.
I am taking a Graduate level Course on Parallel Algorithms next semester. 

%Btp
Currently I am involved in  my B.Tech. Project on ``Program Restructuring for GENSAT'' under the guidance of Dr. D.M. Dhamdhere. Details of the project
are given in my resume. Presently I am implementing an algorithm by 
Zahira Ammargulleat. I have proposed a few changes in her algorithm and 
have proved that the new algorithm would do better than the one proposed
by her, in all the cases. 


A good deal of teaching experience, as seen in my resume, makes me 
confident of my ability to communicate as a teacher.

%univ
%Computer Science at UIUC is one of the best programs to pursue research in the field of
%systems. 

>From the information brochure, web pages and as advised by my 
 guide, Dr. Dhamdhere , I have gathered that a considerable amount of research is being 
done in Systems in UIUC. A number of renowned faculty members of UIUC
are working on the research frontiers of computer science. It would be 
my privelige to work with such renowned researchers, and contribute something
useful to Computer Science.


%Conclusion
 
  I look forward to joing UIUC as a Graduate student at your esteemed
department.

	Statement of Purpose
}
\end{center}

My aspiration to work at the frontiers of Scientific research leads me 
to apply to your university. I believe that a comprehensive  knowledge 
and a good grasp of fundamentals are essential for such  a  career.  I 
feel that Graduate studies in Computer Science in a good  University  like 
yours will help me realize this objective. Therefore I am seeking
admission to the Ph.D.  program  at  
Harvard  with a specialization in  Computer  Science.  
I  have  compelling 
reasons to believe that I will  be  extremely  successful  both  as  a 
Graduate student and later as a researcher.

%As  a  first  step  towards 
%obtaining a Ph.D., I am seeking admission to the Master's  program  at 
%Harvard University with a specialization in  Computer  Science.  I  would 
%prefer doing a direct Ph.D., if it  is  possible.  I  have  compelling 

My superlative performance in school fetched me a number of awards at 
the national level. I was awarded the prestigious National Talent
Search Scholarship in class ten.
%and was in the top twenty five in the
%National Standard Examination in Physics in my twelfth.
I had developed a keen  interest  in  science  and 
decided to choose it  as  my  career.  I  therefore,  took  the  Joint 
Entrance Examination for admission to the  five  Indian  Institute  of 
Technologies, which are  considered  the  best  academic  centers  for 
science and Engineering in India and qualified  in  the  top  0.3\%  of 
those who took the test.

I have always adopted a rigorous approach in order to attain an in-depth 
understanding of the subject at  hand.  This  has  given  me  a  broad 
conceptual basis, which, I  believe,  is  essential  for  my  research 
career.  My  grades  in  the  basic  courses  reflect  my  quest   for 
fundamentals. My overall grades in my undergraduate studies have been good,
but not excellent. This again reflects my approach to courses more as
an introduction to concepts that need further independent study by the
student, rather than as a run-up to a semester-end examination.

Over the past two years in Computer Science I have developed a special 
interest in {\bf Programming Languages and Distributed \& Parallel  Systems.}
I have been involved in research in these areas and have  consistently 
obtained good grades in the related courses. In Spring' 95, I will  be 
taking two Graduate level courses in these fields namely  `Distributed 
Databases' and `Advanced Compilers'. I have written an  article  on 
``Distributed  File  Systems''  with  Prof.  M.R.  Bhujade  which appeared in  
the September 1994 issue of {\bf CSI (Computer Society of India)
Communications}. In this article  the  basic  concepts  underlying  the 
design and  implementation aspects  were  discussed  and  contemporary 
systems like Locus, Andrew and Unix United were surveyed in detail.

I am currently working on  ``Register  Allocation  Algorithms''  for  my 
B.Tech thesis under the guidance of Prof. D.M.Dhamdhere. In my  project 
we have introduced a  technique of live range confinement 
which adapts the live range of a data item to the availability of
register. Instead of splitting a live range like in a  Chow-Hennessy
allocator we are implementing the confinement technique. 
Half way through the project we have already sent part of our work for the 
{\bf ACM SIGPLAN'95
Conference} on {\bf Programming Language Design and Implementation}
sponsored by the {\bf Special Interest Group on Programming Languages,
Association for Computing Machinery.}

%I had also presented a course paper on language Linda  which  consists 
%of operators that embody tuple space model  for  Parallel  programming 
%and involves Distributed Data Structures.

I have a reason also to be  confident of my abilities as a teacher. As
part of a nation wide teaching program, I have taught school children
subjects like Physics, Mathematics and English for four semesters (three
hours per week). This was an interesting experience which I feel would
stand in good stead in the future.

I take immense pleasure in learning  new  concepts.  This  inquisitive 
nature of mine along-with a desire to realize my full  potential  drive 
me to pursue research. I am aware that  research  calls  for  complete 
dedication and commitment. I consider myself to be mature, perceptive, 
persistent and open  to  criticism %  qualities  which  I  believe  are 
%essential for group research.

%by working under the guidance of distinguished professors like Prof. A 
%b ffffffffffffff, whose  interests  match  closely  with  mine,  I  am 
%confident of making an original contribution to the field of  Computer 
%Science. 


I have studied in one of the best institutes of our country and feel
the need to expose myself to research in United States which is
currently a world leader in Computer Science.
I have chosen to pursue Graduate studies at Harvard University because 
the facilities at Harvard  seem to foster a healthy research
environment as I could gather from the brochure of your department.
I believe that I possess  the  motivation,  the  intellectual 
ability, and the preparation to  set  out  on  this  exhilarating  and 
arduous path, to do justice to a demanding Graduate program and to make 
significant contributions to the ongoing work at your University.

\begin{center}	{\Large \bf Statement of Purpose}  \end{center}

	My decision to apply for a {\bf Ph.D.} program at {\bf 
University of Utah} is driven by my aspirations to pursue a research career in
the field of Computer Science. This field interests me because of its
formal and rigorous mathematical nature and its wide-ranging
applications. I believe that a strong and thorough background as well
as complete awareness of recent developments are essential for an
intellectually stimulating and satisfying research career. Towards
realizing this objective at an esteemed department such as yours, I am
applying to your university. An objective analysis of my background,
interests, strengths and weaknesses leads me to believe that I will be
successful both as a Ph.D. candidate and later as a researcher in an
academic milieu. 

\

	Academics has always been my strong-hold. My inquisitive
nature and a strong desire to ingrain the fundamental principles as
well as techniques of any subject of study has enabled me to achieve
an excellent academic record. More importantly, it has inculcated in
me the methodology of scientific inquiry as reflected in my rigorous
and analytic approach to problem solving. This is further evident from
my performance at higher-secondary school level and at IIT Bombay. The
excellent course structure at IIT has given me a sound and broad
conceptual basis, which, I believe, is essential for a research
career. Through many projects I have undertaken in a stimulating
academic environment at IIT where learning and research go
hand-in-hand, I have found that I have a deep  interest in research
work, a strong motivation and an aptitude for the type of problem
solving it involves. 

\

	Over the past two years at IIT, I have cultivated a keen interest
in the field of {\bf Asynchronous Circuits, Formal Design Methods in VLSI}. I
have furthered my knowledge in this field by reading various related
articles and am actively involved in research in this area. I  have
also opted for a graduate level course {\bf IC Design Technology} in Spring
96. I am currently working on {\bf Asynchronous Communication between
Synchronous Finite State Machines} for my B.Tech. thesis under the
guidance of {\bf Prof. S. Ramesh}. I am working towards implementing
communication primitives such as {\bf rendezvous, probe} etc. at gate level
in VLSI circuits. I am investigating different interconnect design
methodologies which can be implemented as {\bf delay-insensitive
asynchronous circuits}. In the first stage of this work, we have
proposed a {\bf new protocol} to implement {\bf asynchronous rendezvous 
communication} and a method to implement this protocol using asynchronous 
circuits. I  firmly believe that this project is a sufficient 
demonstration of my ability to conduct original and independent 
research.  

\

	I have strong reasons to believe that I possess the
temperament for teaching, a good power of speech and a thorough and
extensive knowledge of my field : traits required for a successful
teaching career. I have worked as a teaching assistant in a
nation-wide teaching program for two years. I have also been lecturer
and tutor for three {\bf UNIX workshops} conducted by {\bf CSEA, IIT Bombay} 
which were attended by more than 250 people every time. This experience 
developed and honed my skills of organizing and communicating my thoughts 
in front of a responsive and critical audience. 

\

	I have always attempted to gain insight into the problem at hand
and tackle it from different angles. I am well aware that a career in
research calls for personal commitment and personal sacrifice of time,
leisure and immediate reward. However, my desire to realize my full
potential and to make an original contribution to the field of
Computer Science drive me to pursue a research career, which, I
believe, will give me intellectual satisfaction, gratification of
becoming a contributor to knowledge and personal rewards of learning
and discovery. I not only possess the intellectual ability, sound
preparation and the strong motivation for research but also consider
myself mature, friendly to work with and open to criticism : qualities
essential for group research. 

\

	I believe that a symbiotic relationship between the student
and his department is of utmost importance for a successful graduate
program. Considering the pioneering work going on at your department
in the field of my interest, your department is an ideal choice for an
exciting research career. At the same time, I am confident of
contributing originally to the ongoing work at your department. By
working under the guidance of distinguished faculty at your
department, I am sure, I will be able to exploit my potential to the
fullest.

\

	Keeping this in mind, I look forward to joining {\bf  
University of Utah}.

{\bf \LARGE Statement of Purpose}
\end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

I, Anil Kumar Ruia, am applying to Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for admission to the Ph.D. program in Computer Science.  I
am especially interested in Theoretical Computer Science including the
design and analysis of algorithms like Approximation algorithms,
Randomized algorithms, Parallel Algorithms and Complexity Theory and
Combinatorics.

I have a strong background in Mathematics. I was placed in the merit
list in Mathematics in school and high school and secured the $1^{st}$
position amongst 100,000 candidates in the all India Joint Entrance
Examination (JEE) for the IITs.  My first exposure to computers came
via programming in high school and I found it so stimulating that I
decided to pursue a career in Computer Science.

At the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, the excellent
facility, faculty and the wide spectrum of courses have given me an
excellent command on the fundamentals of Computer Science.  I have
always been fascinated by abstract Mathematics and I have found
Theoretical Computer Science just the right blend of abstract
Mathematics and concrete Computer Science.  My interest in this field
has kept on growing with courses like {\bf Discrete Structures}, {\bf
Data Structures and Algorithms} and {\bf Theory of Computation} which
have been my favorites.

My B. Tech. Seminar (Junior Thesis) included a literature survey on
{\em Topological Graph Theory\/} and my B. Tech. Project (Senior
Thesis) is on {\em Combinatorics and Algorithms\/} in which I am
attempting to obtain better solutions to various problems like
constructing minimal fault tolerant circuits and approximation
algorithms to construct maximal planar subgraph.  This has given me
experience in mastering abstract Mathematical concepts as well as in
designing good algorithms for simply expressed practical problems.  My
skills and interest in this field have been further improved upon by
courses such as {\bf Design and Analysis of Algorithms} and {\bf
Geometric Algorithms} in which I have been exposed to randomized
algorithms for problems in computational geometry.  To further improve
my command in this field, I have taken {\bf Foundations of Parallel
Computation} and {\bf Information Theory and Coding} for the coming
semester.  I am also attending a lecture series on the $P$ vs $NC$
problem.

I strongly feel that Algorithms and Complexity theory are the core
subjects in Computer Science and problems in all fields can be handled
using these techniques.  This area also has a large potential for
research and this is what I envisage myself doing a few years from
now, preferably in an academic environment.

I am convinced that I should pursue a career in research and teaching.
For me, problem solving is an experience unmatched by anything else.
It would give me immense pleasure to be able to contribute something
to this subject.  My limited teaching experience as tutor in an
introductory undergraduate programming course has been very positive
and I would love to be able to teach my favorite subjects and thus get
a better understanding of these fields myself.

I have heard a lot from IIT alumni and faculty about the excellent
faculty in Theoretical Computer Science, the research done in this
field and the performance of the students who have graduated from MIT.
I am sure that the stimulating academic environment and interaction
with the distinguished faculty will prove immensely fruitful and
facilitate my development as an individual researcher in my field. I
feel that MIT has a lot to offer me, and at the same time, I am
confident that I would be able to make a positive contribution to
on-going research work at MIT.

With these long-term goals in mind, my immediate objective is to work
towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science.  Having decided that I will
engage in a career in research, I am aware of the kind of dedication,
resilience and resolve I will have to show over the years.  I feel
that I am adequately prepared for that, both in having the technical
qualifications and the right mind-set for doctoral level research.

I look forward to joining as a graduate student in your department.

{\Huge \bf Statement of Purpose}
\end{center}

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My goals}}\\

	I, Ashwin Shrinivas, am applying to the University of
California, Santa Barbara for admission to the Ph.D. program in Computer
Science. My goal is to pursue a career in research, either in industry
or in academia. Ten years from now, I envisage myself as a full-fledged
research professional in an organization, or a faculty member at one of
the leading universities. A Ph.D. is an important first step in
achieving this objective.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My background}}\\

Though I was exposed to some aspects of Computer Science in my
last two years of school, a comprehensive foundation in all the fields
of Computer Science began after I entered IIT Bombay. The Computer
Science department at IIT Bombay is indisputably among the best in the 
country. Its excellent courses, faculty and learning environment have
given me a firm grounding in all the fields of Computer Science.

My academic and co-curricular record has been consistently good.
Throughout school as well as now, I have been at or near the top of my
class. My class at IIT Bombay consists of 36 students, chosen from an
All India exam involving 100,000 students. I myself was $9^{th}$ in that
exam. I have listed some of my achievements on the attached resum\'{e}.

I am of the opinion that research requires a firm grounding in theory
backed up by an in-depth knowledge of systems and implementation. The
important courses of {\em Discrete Structures}, {\em Data Structures \&
Algorithms}, and {\em Theory of Computation} have given me a good
knowledge of theory. In addition, I am doing the course {\em Design \&
Analysis of Algorithms} this semester and {\em Parallel Algorithms} next
semester, in order to further firm up my foundations. My performance in
lab courses attests to my knowledge of systems and programming.

My strengths are my consistency, capacity for hard work, and my ability
to work in a team. I have been involved in many course projects which
involved a group of students, and I have been the team leader in quite
a few of these. I believe that research involves new ideas, as well as
consistent effort to back them up, both of which I am capable of.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My primary interests}}\\

I prefer research problems to be an ideal mix of theory and practice.
The field of {\bf Databases} interests me because of the scope for
breaking new ground, as well as the vast applications possible. I
believe that {\bf Distributed Databases}, in particular, is an area
with a lot of potential. My grounding in this field is solid, which is
reflected in my obtaining the best possible grade in both the courses
involving Databases, namely, {\em Business Information Systems} and
{\em Database Management Systems}, and in their respective labs too.
Currently, I am working on my Senior Thesis under Dr. S. Seshadri,
in which we are looking at the problem of {\em Garbage Collection in
Persistent Object Stores}. We plan to submit it for publication after
running some performance tests, which we are designing. I have included
details in my resum\'{e}.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf Why California-Santa Barbara ?}}\\

Since all fields in Computer Science are highly interlinked, I want to
pursue graduate studies at a University that is strong in all fields of
Computer Science. I am aware that the department of Computer Science at
the University of California, Santa Barbara is one of the best in the world,
being particularly strong in Databases (my primary interest).
Dr. Seshadri also recommends it highly. These facts have led me to apply
to California-Santa Barbara.

There is one more ({\em and the most compelling}) reason. In the course
of my Senior Thesis, I have come across related work by
Dr. D. Agrawal. His work has interested me immensely, and I would
like to participate in some of the projects he is undertaking.
Subsequently I corresponded with Dr. Agrawal, and his encouraging
reply and description of the work at the department reinforced my
decision to apply.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf Financial Aid}}\\

I would be fully dependent on aid to finance my graduate studies. If I
am granted an assistantship, then given my long term goals, a research
assistantship would be an ideal experience for me. I have already 
mentioned my interest in research. I also have some
experience in teaching. I have been a lecturer \& demonstrator in
student workshops held in various colleges in the region. I was also
involved in a nationwide program which involved teaching school
children. The good response to my efforts, coupled with my prowess in
dramatics, elocution \& debating gives me the confidence to handle any
teaching assignment.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My plans if admitted}}\\

I plan to carry on advanced study of Databases, as well as related
fields (e.g. Algorithms), not only through coursework but also by
{\em participating in one of the several ongoing projects}.
This will also give me the opportunity to contribute my bit to the
understanding of the fields which interest me so much.

I am aware that the University of California, Santa Barbara expects very high
standards from its students. My track record gives me the confidence
that I will be able to meet those expectations. I believe that my
association with the Computer Science department will be a mutually
profitable one.

\begin{flushleft}
{\bf Academic \& Career Objectives}
\end{flushleft}

	My long term career goals include the pursuit of research in
the field of Theoretical Computer Science and teaching in an academic
environment. I have found that a career in research is both
intellectually stimulating and satisfying and hence I have decided to
take this up as my career objective.

\begin{flushleft}
{\bf Degree Objectives}
\end{flushleft}

	I want to work towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science in the
field of Theoretical Computer Science. My interests include both the
design and analysis of Algorithms as well as Computational Complexity Theory.

\begin{flushleft}
{\bf Reason for Graduate Work}
\end{flushleft}

	I have always been fascinated by mathematics. As a part of my
undergraduate curriculum, I have been exposed to a range of
advanced mathematical techniques and I have been especially drawn towards
both the analysis of Algorithms and Complexity Theory. These fields
have both a strong mathematical flavor as well as the potential for
research which is what attracts me towards them.

	The fact that these subjects form a unifying feature of all
fields in Computer Science and their quest towards achieving the limits
of what can and can't be done, form part of the reasons for my
fascination in them.

	An undergraduate degree is merely an exposure to the various
fields in any branch of higher education. I feel that my
undergraduate curriculum has given me a sufficient enough exposure to
all the various possibilities for research that are possible and I
have chosen the one for which I have both an aptitude as well as a liking.
%that I both have an aptitude for as well as a
%liking.

	In order to pursue an active career in research, it is
necessary to both study and understand the finer nuances of any
subject. I believe that Graduate Studies will not only provide me with
advanced knowledge about the field but also prepare me to be a good
researcher. It is precisely this reason which prompts me to take up
Graduate Studies as the next step towards my career objectives.

\newpage

	As an initial step towards achieving my goal, as part of my
undergraduate studies, I have chosen my electives so as to enhance my
understanding of these subjects. These include such subjects as
{\tt Design \& Analysis of Algorithms}, {\tt Combinatorics} and
{\tt Abstract Algebra I}. I have also audited (taken as non-credit)
a Graduate level course {\tt Algorithms \& Complexity}.
I have attended an Advanced Mathematics Training Programme in
Summer '93 so as to enhance my mathematical abilities.

{\bf Why have I chosen Stanford}
\end{flushleft}

	I have chosen Stanford as the place at which I would
like to pursue a doctoral degree because I find that the graduate
program is fully suited to my needs and that it possesses a strong
faculty in the field of Theoretical Computer Science.

        I have also consulted the professors in my university who are
working in the field of Algorithms and Complexity Theory and they have
strongly recommended the research work in these fields at Stanford.

        Hence, I have applied to Stanford so as to fulfill
both my academic as well as my career objectives.

                        Statement  of  Purpose
                        ----------------------


My goals:
--------

After considering my aptitude and the type of work that I like to do,
I am convinced that I want to take up a research career in Computer
Science.  Since a good research career can only be built on the firm
foundation of good education, my immediate objective is to pursue a
Ph.D. in Computer Science. 

My background and my primary interests:
--------------------------------------

I have always had an excellent academic record. I was awarded
scholarships at the National level in the 10th and 12th
standards. Later, I secured the 151st rank among 100,000 candidates
(99.8 percentile) in the All India Joint Entrance Examination for
admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology. Due to my keen
interest in Mathematics and fascination for computers, I chose
Computer Science and Engineering as my major field. The excellent
facilities, courses and faculty at IIT-Bombay have given me a lot of
drill in both theoretical as well as implementational aspects of
computer science. I believe that this combined with the mathematics
courses that I have taken forms a sound foundation for graduate
study. 

During the course of the B.Tech. program, I have developed a
keen interest in Systems. My experience in Systems includes, besides
the courses listed in the sheet titled Computer Science Background, a
number of projects such as a project on linux NFS, an implementation
of extendible hashing for a toy DBMS and an implementation of a
compiler for a subset of Pascal. As far as research experience goes, I
am working on my B.Tech. project (Senior Thesis) titled `Surface Design
for 3-D Graphics', under the guidance of Prof. Milind Sohoni and
Prof. Sachin Patkar. I have included a brief summary of all these
projects separately. I shall also be doing a course in Parallel
Computing under Prof. Abhiram Ranade. All these courses and projects
give me a firm foundation in Systems and I intend to build upon this
foundation in my graduate studies.

Other activities:
----------------

I have been actively involved in various co-curricular and
extra-curricular activities.  I have regularly participated in
Elocution and Dramatics competitions and have won prizes. I am also a
member of the IEEE and the IEEE Computer Society.

Teaching experience:
-------------------

I have some experience as a teaching and laboratory assistant for an
institute level course for the first year undergraduates. Not only did
I enjoy it, but the students also appreciated it. This gives me
confidence that I will be a good teacher as well.

Why UCSD ?
----------

I believe that in order to be a successful researcher, one must not
only be a master of one's field, but also have a feel of other related
fields.  Hence, I want to pursue graduate studies at a university
which has an excellent program in Systems and is also good in other
fields of computer science. UCSD satisfies this criteria perfectly. I
am sure that working in such an excellent setup will give me valuable
research experience and enable me to produce an excellent output in my
Ph.D.

In conclusion:
-------------

I am aware that UCSD expects very high standards from its students. On
my part, I can assure you of sincerity and hardwork.  I am confident
that my enthusiasm will enable me to meet your expectations. 

Eagerly looking forward to joining the University of California,

\noindent
My schooling and three and a half years of undergraduate studies in EE at
the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay have made the choice of further
study, for me, an obvious one.  This should be attributed in part to the
values that have been inculcated in me during my formative years in an 
educated middle class family background.

\noindent
Beginning with a passing interest in EE, these years of in depth study
have convinced me that my future lies in microelectronics.  The challenges
and possibilities for research in device, analog and digital circuit, and 
VLSI circuit design fascinate me.  This I believe has come about through
a sequentially structured introduction to this field through the courses: \\
Modern Physics, 
Electronic Devices, 
Analog Circuits, 
Digital Circuits, 
Integrated Circuit Design and Technology. 

\noindent
In addition, I have worked on a number of related projects.
I have worked on MOS capacitor characterization under Prof.
Rakesh Lal using a quasi static approach.  My B.tech seminar (home paper)
dealt with Monte Carlo simulations of small Si MOSFETs.  My guide was
Prof. J. Vasi of the EE Dept. of IIT Bombay. I have undergone
eight weeks of practical training in a Dept. of Electronics lab where I
studied the theoretical and practical aspects of active and passive
coupling of edge emitting semiconductor lasers to optical fibers.  An LD-SM
optical fiber module was made and experiments were carried out.  In
my senior year I presented a seminar on Noise in Semiconductor Devices under
the Microelectronics Seminar Series at IIT Bombay.  My senior year B.Tech
project (senior thesis) involves design of ultra low noise analog circuits.
The final goal of the project is to design, with an intent to fabricate, an
ultra low noise integrated circuit operational amplifier.  My B.Tech project
work is progressing under the guidance of Prof. D. K. Sharma of the EE Dept.
of IIT Bombay.  I can quite        
confidently say that my abilities in circuit visualization, analysis, and
design are unparalleled in my department.
In the process of pursuing my interests in EE, my academic performance has
been outstanding.  I have been consistently ranked 2nd in EE out of 64 
students, and 8th in IIT Bombay out of 325 students.  I was included in 
the director's academic honor list for the academic years
\begin{itemize}
\item 1991-1992
\item 1992-1993
\end{itemize}

\noindent
My academic pursuits have not however, prevented from participating with
interest in various extracurricular activities.  I have taken part in
various literary activities.  I am a regular participant in elocution
competitions and debating society meetings and have been the editor of 
the hostel magazine.  These activities, have led to the development of 
a multifaceted personality and have equipped me with strong interpersonal
skills.  This helps me to lead, as well as follow the leader when working
as a team.

\noindent
>From where I stand now, I see myself engaged, in the long term, in a career
devoted to active research in microelectronics.  It is with this objective 
in mind that I want to pursue an M.S. at Stanford University.  My ultimate degree 
objective, would however be a Ph.D.
In choosing Stanford University as the university of my choice, I've looked carefully
at the faculty and the available infrastructure.  

\noindent
The essence of university education lies in the success of the symbiotic
relationship between the student, and his department.  With your repute
in the field of my choice, you do have a lot to offer me, and at the
same time, I am confident of contributing meaningfully to the research 
endeavors at your University. It is with this in mind that I am looking forward to
a long and rewarding relationship with you.

Statement Of Purpose

Introduction:

	As we near the end of the twentieth century we can see the ever
growing need for computer technology. Over the centuries man has always wanted to
compute, and process information as quickly as possible. he has also
wanted to communicate with his fellow human beings who are widely
distributed over this vast world. No one thirty years ago would ever
dream of computers being used as they are in the information
superhighway, rather than for scientific computing. 
The sudden boom
in the use of computers today, is evident by the visible 70% increase in
the number of hosts on the Internet yearly. Man has needed computers
not only to control the forces of nature, but also those of distance,
and time.


	Ever since I was a child I have been interested in mathematics,
and have always stood first in my class in it. When my teenage years 
came along, I decided that I would pursue a career in mathematics and
science. It was with this hope that I studied very deligently for the IIT
entrance exam. My hard work payed off, and I joined IIT (Bombay) for a
bachelors degree in computer science and Engg. During my stay at IIT,
I was introduced to computers in my very first month. It was an extremely
exciting experience because it was the first time I had used a
computer, since the use of computers in our country, is only restricted for
those who are financially well off.

My Work:
	At IIT, I was introduced to various new concepts in computer
science. The very first courses of Discrete Structures, and Data
structures, aroused my interest immediately. I started also getting
interested in Databases, Computer Architecture, and Compilers. I did
my Bachelor's seminar project "Building Applications using the Object
Oriented Paradigm" under the guidance of Prof. N.L. Sarda. It mainly
consisted of studying the Object-Oriented Paradigm, and Object-Oriented
Databases. I studied how to build Object-Oriented Applications above
relational databases, which came in use during my short job with
Burroughs Wellcome pharmaceuticals, in building an Engineering
inventory system for them. I also studied how objects are stored, and
indexed in Object-Oriented Databases.
	My Bachelor of Tech. project consists of parallelising
sequential code and running independent sections of code in parallel.
For doing this I have been studying data dependence issues. During the
course of my work I got particularly interested in Exact Array
Dependence. I have read a lot of papers related to the
field. Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharrya is my guide on this project.

	
My Purpose
	My vocation has always been to work towards new frontiers of
technology, and always work with the purpose of getting the best
result. Over the last few years during my stay at IIT, I have become
motivated towards pursuing a career in research. Research has
interested me, because one is always working on something new, that no one
else has worked on, and one can always pursue one's own interest to the
fullest. Research provides one with new challenges daily, which one
won't come across in other jobs. I strongly believe in both
the theoretical aspects of research as well as their applications.
I consider the latter to be as important and relevant as the former.
I am extremely interested in pursuing a MS/PHD at your university. 
I am primarily interested in Databases, Parallel systems and graphics.

	In fact, ten years from now, I envisage myself as a full fledged
research professional in an organisation or a faculty member at one of the leading universities. In order to fulfil this aim of mine, I seek to enrol for a
MS/PHD in computer science at your University. Through the department brochure
I realize that a vast gamut of opportunities exist in your department. Hence
I am keen in joining your program, and furthering your research.


My Good And Bad Points:

	I strongly believe in maintaining ethical integrity in all my
endeavours. The maintenance of strong christian values is of utmost
importance in my work. I am also a very friendly person to work with.
My bad qualities include having a bad memory, and being absent minded.

	I would like to end by saying that that I am fully aware that a career
in research and academics requires a high level of intelligence, unwavering 
dedication and a lot of sacrifice. I am confident that I would meet all the
above demands, and hence I appeal to the Graduate Admissions Committee to
consider me for admission, and financial aid.

\vspace{.2in}

        I am a final year student of  the  B.  Tech.  program  in
Computer  Science  and  Engineering  at  the  Indian Institute of
Technology, Bombay.

My undergraduate preparation here has given me a very
substantial knowledge of the basic areas of Computer Science.
I have always strived to develop a  clear  understanding  of  the  basic
concepts and acquire an insight into the Science of Computing.
Any amount of learning in Computer Science would be incomplete without
hands on experience of Programming. In this regard I have completed various 
projects, both as part of my courses and out my own interest also.


Of the many fields in the Computer Science spectrum, I have developed
a keen interest in Declarative Programming Languages, Computer Graphics, 
 Computational Geometry and Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

        I  have  excelled  in  academics  at  every  step  in  my
education.  In  my  12 years of schooling I always ranked first/second 
in the class. In the entrance examination for the IITs, I stood 17th 
among 80,000 students. I have consistantly done well throughout my 
undergraduate studies also. My GPA is 8.38/10.00 after the end of
seventh semester. 

	
        The  urge  to  obtain  an  in-depth   understanding   and
specialized  knowledge  in  my areas of interest, has made me opt
for Graduate studies. I would  like  to  follow  up  my  graduate
studies  by taking up a research oriented post in either academia
or research laboratories so that I can contribute my own  bit  to
the ever-increasing knowledge in these areas.

        I believe that the initiation of the process of  original
contribution  is  best done by working towards a Ph.D. I view the
masters degree as an intermediate step in  achieving  this  goal.
Hence,  I would like to take up an M.S. culminating in a Ph.D. as
my immediate goal.

%%%% Univ para
	From the information about current faculty research, which I obtained 
from the application brochure, I find that pioneering  research work is
being done in declarative languages and related architectures at the
Arizona State University.
Being part of such an excellent research team will be a big  step in  
achieving   my long   term   goals.   The  highly competitive and 
intellectually stimulating atmosphere at the Arizona State university
will  bring   out the   best  in  me. 
 This  prompts me to apply for graduate studies at your university.

        Keeping in view my background and career plans,  I  would
prefer  a  research  assistantship but I would  also like to have 
teaching experience. I have studied in English medium through out
and have had teaching experience here in IIT also, which makes me confident
that I would be a successful teaching assistant.

        In conclusion, I would  say  that  I  am  very  keen  and
enthusiastic about joining your university. I am aware of the hard work and 
perseverence necessary for research work but
I am sure that I will be able to justify to the fullest the confidence reposed in me.

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
	I am a senior year student in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, one of the
most renowned institutes for undergraduate studies in India. My decision
to pursue graduate studies has been motivated by my eventual objective of 
meaningful research in the field of {\bf Computer Networks} and {\bf Communications}. I firmly believe that I possess the requisite background and aptitude
for pursuing active research in this field at your University.\\

\noindent
	A strong desire to ingrain the fundamental principles of any subject
of study has enabled me to adopt a rigorous and analytical approach to problem
solving. More importantly, it has inculcated in me the methodology of 
scientific inquiry. Throughout schooling I maintained the first position in
my class. In consonance with my interests, I worked towards obtaining admission
to the Indian Institutes of Technology and secured a rank of 92 among 85,000
candidates who appeared in the entrance examination. Computer Science and
Engineering was a natural choice for my undergraduate studies in light of 
my fascination for computers.\\

\noindent
	My interest in research has burgeoned during the course of my
undergraduate studies at IIT, Bombay. My major field of interest is computer
networks and telecommunications. At present I am working on my senior year
B.\ Tech.\ Project on {\bf Fast Packet Switching in ATM Networks} under the guidance of Dr.\ M.\  Khalid. It involves the 
design of a non-blocking Disjoint Path Packet Switch and the analysis of its 
performance in terms of the throughput, delay, packet loss rate, hardware complexity and the ease of growability. The proposed switch combines the 
delay/throughput performance  of $N^{2}$ disjoint path switches and the 
multicasting performance of Shared Medium switches in a single architecture.
The attempt is to reduce the hardware cost
of implementing the switch without compromising on any of the performance
characteristics of an ideal packet switch. To consolidate my knowledge in 
this field I had also taken an elective course titled {\em Introduction to
Computer Networks} last semester in which I got the highest grade in the class.\\

\noindent
Apart from delving deep into the field of Computer Networks, I have tried 
to broaden  my perspectives in other fields of Computer Science as well. 
In my junior year I presented a Seminar on {\bf Anti-aliasing in Computer Graphics}
under the guidance of Dr. Sharat Chandran. The seminar involved an
exhaustive study of the various anti-aliasing techniques used to overcome
the jagged effects arising due to the discrete sampling in a raster graphics
system. I also implemented an anti-aliasing software package as part of 
a project in an elective course on Computer Graphics.\\  

\noindent
I also have the ability
to work in a group project effectively. I had done my industrial training in
the Regional Computer Center at Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and
during the course of the summer project I developed a data compression
package. The 
practical  experience I gained after working in such a big organization
has  given me immense confidence in tackling time-bound practical 
problems.\\

\noindent
My 
undergraduate studies in the invigorating environment of IIT, Bombay has
given me substantial knowledge of the basic areas of Computer Science. I
believe that I also possess the ability and temperament to function 
effectively as a Teaching Assistant. I was an assistant for a course on Computer Programming for freshmen and I have helped in organizing two
workshops on UNIX and C conducted by our department. \\

\noindent
Having been part of an exacting undergraduate program at IIT,
Bombay, I have internalized the desire to explore frontline knowledge in my 
research area. I believe that the Graduate Program at your University will
provide me the opportunity to satisfy the same and enable further honing 
of my technical and analytical skills acquired thus far. I am fully aware 
of the commitment and perseverance required for research and believe that
my aptitude and motivation will see me through the challenge. I am also
confident that given an opportunity, I can contribute to the ongoing work 
in your graduate program in a productive manner. I therefore look forward 
to joining your University for pursuing higher studies leading to a Master's/Doctoral degree.\\

{\Huge Statement of Purpose}
\end{center}

	My objective in graduate studies is to prepare myself for my
long term goal of a career in research and teaching in Computer Science. 
The first step in that direction is pursuit of Ph.D. in Computer Science.

	Ever since I was in high school, I wanted to be a scientist. 
Hence I joined IIT
Bombay, where I chose Computer Science as my undergraduate major.
The undergraduate programme in Computer Science and Engg. in 
IIT Bombay is unarguably one of the best in India and 
the core courses in the undergrad curriculum have helped me get a 
a sound grasp of the fundamentals of almost all aspects of Computer Science,
which is reflected by my position in the top five in a class of 33. 
At IIT, I also discovered the 
intellectual satisfaction of solving difficult problems on my own. 
In the summer vacation after the first year, I worked for some time with 
a research scholar in the department of Computer Science and Engg. 
This work led to a research paper,
``Heuristics for Distributed Knowledge-Based Systems'', which was published in 
1994. Because of this and my success in the undergraduate courses, 
I feel that a career in research is suited both to my aptitude and temperament.

	My idea of research in graduate studies is a proper balance of 
theory and practice. i.e. to get theoretical results and to see, as far as
possible, the 
immediate impact of the same through their implementation. I am aware of the 
tough and arduous nature of this task and willing to take on this challenge.
I believe that I have the requisite intellectual ability, motivation and the
willingness to sacrifice leisure for work in order to fulfill my objective 
of scientific research and the attainment of intellectual satisfaction 
therefrom. Thus I believe that I will be able to make a meaningful 
contribution to the research work at Rice University. 

	The exacting nature of the undergraduate labs in IIT Bombay 
have already given me a comprehensive knowledge of systems and 
systems programming. But I feel that a 
strong background in theory is essential for a successful career in research 
in an academic environment. 
	So in order to augment the  knowledge of theory which I got from the 
core courses, I am trying to learn
as much of theory as possible in my undergraduate programme. I took two
courses on {\em Algorithms} and one on {\em Formal Specification and Verification of Programs} for my department electives in the seventh semester
and I will be taking a course in {\em Combinatorics}
next semester. My credit seminar topic viz. {\bf Randomized Algorithms} under the guidance of Prof. Sundar Vishwanathan, was
also in theory. Looking at the beautiful results in algorithms, I am sure that I
would be exhilarated to get some new exciting results on my own. But 
implementing the results and proving their practicality would give me 
greater satisfaction. My one-year B. Tech. Project, under the guidance of 
Prof. D. M. Dhamdhere, involves the design and 
implementation of an {\bf Optimizer Generator System}. In this, I have to
come up with my own idea for implementing inter-procedural may-aliasing. 

Currently, my research interests are in Parallelizing and  Optimizing 
compilers and I have worked in both. I am also interested in Algorithms.
I am eager to explore some of these in greater depth and make my own 
contribution, howsoever small, to those fields.

During my preparation for my B. Tech. Project, I read 
numerous research papers from Rice University. 
Thus my choice of Rice University for graduate 
studies is based on a careful examination of the 
information regarding the faculty members and the research currently going on 
in your school. 

I look forward to joining your department as 
a graduate student. I am confident that 
graduate studies in Rice University will prove to be a rewarding 
task and I shall be able to fulfill my career objectives.

ANDA:

My undergraduate studies in the department of computer Science and
Engg at IIT Bombay have exposed me to a stimulating academic
environment where learning and research go together

 The possibilities of research in this field 
fascinate me. 

I have excelled in academics at every step in my education. Throughout
twelve years of schooling I have always been ranked among the top of
my class. I was introduced to Computer Science in junior college. I
was awarded the Merit Certificate for my performance in the All India
Senior School Certificate Examination - {\bf 100\%} in Computer
Science, {\bf 99\%} in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. I was also
placed seventh in the state wide Physics Talent Test of the Physics
Society, Madras. In the highly competitive entrance examination to the
IITs I was ranked 134th among over 100,000 students.


 Working under an expert whose work can serve as a model will
set me on the path to contributing significantly to the ongoing
research at UCLA.  The research interests of the other faculty members
cover a large number of topics in Computer Science and this will
enable me to keep in touch with the latest developments in these
fields. The excellent facilities offered by your department will
provide an environment conducive to successful graduate work


BAPAT:

In  turn  I shall  get
intellectual  satisfaction  and  the gratification of becoming  a
contributor  to   knowledge   through  research  and  the greater
personal rewards of  learning  and  discovery

BARVE:

I have performed reasonably well in my undergraduate courses at IIT,but
since IIT admits only the best students throughout the country, I 
believe ,in view of the competitive atmosphere, that the grades secured
should not be considered in an absolute sense.

BRAJESH:

Long Term Goals

My undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science and En-
gineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay has exposed me to
a stimulating academic environment where learning and research go hand-in-
hand.  Through the many opportunities I have had here, I have found that I
have a deep interest in research work and a strong aptitude for the type of pro*
 *b-
lem solving and problem discovery that it involves. I have, therefore decided to
pursue active research in Computer Science as a career.


CHANDE:

After carefully considering my aptitude, interests, the nature of my training
and my ultimate professional ambition, I have decided to pursue Ph. D. in
electrical engineering specialising in the fields of my interest namely-
Communications, Signal Processing and Information Theory and Coding,
ultimately leading to a career in teaching and research. As a 
statement of purpose of my graduate study, I describe here my academic
background, my research interests and my career goals.   


CHANDE:

>From the residential system of IIT Bombay, I have been able to have a glimpse
of the academic life and the sacrifices it involves. I feel that it is this
kind of life that I am best suited for. I feel that I have enough           
motivation to see me through the challenges of the arduous but exhilarating 
career in research.

CMS:

My decision to apply to {\bf Indiana University} is based on a careful
examination of the department brochure, world wide web information and
talking to my guide Dr. S. Ramesh. Indiana has a strong faculty in Programming
Language Design. Entering the Ph. D. program here will be ideal for me.


ESSEL:

My training at I.I.T., Bombay has not only equipped me with a strong
technical base but has also instilled in me a deep interest in
research.

Study in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at I.I.T., Bombay has demanded long hours of continuous work, self-motivated efforts and a
considerable amount of group activity. It has given me several
opportunities to participate in various departmental activities,
albeit in a small way. Learning by myself and sharing my knowledge
with others has always been of prime importance to me. I have limited
teaching  experience from tutoring an elementary course on FORTRAN-77 for
students of first year B.Tech. program. I enjoyed the experience and
would  like to teach in future too

I look upon graduate study as an avenue to refine my skills and give
a direction to my research career. It would be my first chance to make
fundamental contribution to the field in which I undertake research.


RPG:

 An objective analysis of my background,
interests, strengths and weaknesses leads me to believe that I will be
successful both as a Ph.D. candidate and later as a researcher in an
academic milieu. 

	Over the past two years at IIT, I have cultivated a keen interest
in the field of {\bf Asynchronous Circuits, Formal Design Methods in VLSI}. I
have furthered my knowledge in this field by reading various related
articles and am actively involved in research in this area. I  have
also opted for a graduate level course {\bf IC Design Technology} in Spring
96. I am currently working on {\bf Asynchronous Communication between
Synchronous Finite State Machines} for my B.Tech. thesis under the
guidance of {\bf Prof. S. Ramesh}. I am working towards implementing
communication primitives such as {\bf rendezvous, probe} etc. at gate level
in VLSI circuits. I am investigating different interconnect design
methodologies which can be implemented as {\bf delay-insensitive
asynchronous circuits}. In the first stage of this work, we have
proposed a {\bf new protocol} to implement {\bf asynchronous rendezvous 
communication} and a method to implement this protocol using asynchronous 
circuits. I  firmly believe that this project is a sufficient 
demonstration of my ability to conduct original and independent 
research.  

I believe that a symbiotic relationship between the student
and his department is of utmost importance for a successful graduate
program. Considering the pioneering work going on at your department
in the field of my interest, your department is an ideal choice for an
exciting research career. At the same time, I am confident of
contributing originally to the ongoing work at your department. By
working under the guidance of distinguished faculty at your
department, I am sure, I will be able to exploit my potential to the
fullest.

SHISHIR:

{\large {\bf Strengths}}\\
There are a few things whose value I realized during my undergraduate
studies and now I strongly believe in them. These are {\em hard work}
-- Necessity to produce results, {\em discipline} -- Necessity to finish 
task before deadlines and {\em persistence} -- Necessity to sail through 
unproductive periods. My attempt throughout has been to inculcate these 
qualities in myself in which, I believe, I have been fairly successful.\\
 
\noindent
{\large {\bf Weaknesses}}\\
A major weakness of mine has been my speed. I always try to attack a problem
in depth which invariably requires some amount of time. As a result, I have not
been able to perform very well in ``three hour'' exams. This weakness has been 
reflected in my grades. However, given sufficient time I have always been able
to show good results, reflected by the good grades (AA or AB) in 
lab courses involving projects.\\

CRAI:

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that I possess the required 
background and the ability to make a significant contribution to Computer
Science and to Cornell. This is testified by my excellent academic record
from school through my undergraduate years. I hope you will take
a favorable decision regarding my admission to the Ph.D. program 
and look forward to joining the Department. \\

During the course of my education at IIT,  I  have  realized  and
felt  convinced that my true liking and aptitude lies in research
and teaching. Research and teaching go  hand  in  hand.  Teaching
gives one a sense of constructive participation in the education
process. Research enables a person to  stay  in  touch  with  the
latest  advances,  while  making  one's  own contributions to the
field.

interest. This has resulted in my high GPA of 8.92/10.00  by  the
end of sixth semester.

        The  urge  to  obtain  an  in-depth   understanding   and
specialized  knowledge  in  my areas of interest, has made me opt
for Graduate studies. I would  like  to  follow  up  my  graduate
studies  by taking up a research oriented post in either academia
or research laboratories so that I can contribute my own  bit  to
the ever-increasing knowledge in these areas.

        I believe that the initiation of the process of  original
contribution  is  best done by working towards a Ph.D. I view the
masters degree as an intermediate step in  achieving  this  goal.
Hence,  I would like to take up an M.S. culminating in a Ph.D. as
my immediate goal.

        From my literature survey, I find that the research  work
in  Computer  Graphics at Cornell University is state of the art.
The additional information I  got  from  my  correspondence  with
Prof.   Greenberg and from my brother Rajendra Kolhe who is doing
his Ph.D.  at your university,  have  confirmed  my  belief  that
Cornell  is  the  college  where  I  want to pursue my Ph.D.  The
computer graphics program at Cornell is considered to be  one  of
the best programs in the world in this field.  Being part of such
an excellent research team will be a big  step in  achieving   my
long   term   goals.   The  highly competitive and intellectually
stimulating atmosphere at Cornell  University   will  bring   out
the   best  in  me.  This  prompts me to apply for the program in
Computer Graphics at Cornell University.

        Keeping in view my background and career plans,  I  would
prefer  a  research  assistantship.  This  would give me a better
opportunity to pursue my interest  to  the  fullest.  However,  I
would  also like to have teaching experience for one semester. As
I  have studied  in  an  English  medium  throughout   and   also
have the experience of being a course assistant  and  a  lecturer
in  two workshops,  I  am  confident that I will be a  successful
teaching assistant.

        In conclusion, I would  say  that  I  am  very  keen  and
enthusiastic about joining your university. I am sure that I will
be able to justify to the fullest the confidence reposed in me.

	I have always cherished a career in research and training in
Computer Science. I feel that graduate studies at a good university
like yours in pursuit of a PhD would be a step in that direction. I am
confident that I will be extremely successful both as a graduate
student and later as a researcher and teacher.

	Ever since I was in school, I was interested in
Mathemetics. My success at the Regional Maths Olympiad and The
National Talent Search examinations boosted this interest. I was also
introduced to programming in school and was fascinated by
computers. With these interests Computer Science was the ideal choice
as my undergraduate major.

	The Computer Science and Engineering department at IIT Bombay
has a good faculty and a wonderful course structure. It is undoubtedly
one of the best in the country. The undergraduate curriculum here
exposed me to all the basic areas in Computer Science and I have
consistently performed well in all the core courses. I have always
adopted a rigorous approach to learning and have tried to grasp the
fundamentals of all the subjects. This is amply reflected in my GPA of
9.09 on 10(3.80 on 4) in a highly competitive class and in my position
in the top 5% of my batch in the institute.

	Over the past one and a half years I have developed an
interest in the field of Programming Languages and Systems, especially
compilers. I have performed well in the basic systems courses like
Language Processors, Programming Languages, Database management
systems and Operating systems (please refer the resume). I have also
chosen as one of my electives for Spring 96 the course titled
Foundations of parallel computation. 

	I am currently working on my B. Tech thesis - which is in the
field of compilers - under the guidance of Prof. D.M. Dhamdhere. I am
involved in the development of GENSAT - a generator for static
analysis and transformation programs. We have already incorporated
into GENSAT a framework to implement intraprocedural data flow
analysis using bitvectors for the representation of data flow
properties. I am extending this framework by providing for the usage
of sets instead of bitvectors. This will make GENSAT a generic tool
for solving monotone dataflow problems. I am also studying various
techniques for interprocedural data flow analysis. My aim here is to
abstract a framework in which these techniques can be implemented. In
this pocess I will be modifying existing algorithms and possibly
finding a new one.

	My interests are well supported by my strong theoretical
background. In my junior year I presented a home paper on the
"Theoretical Consequences of the Ellipsoid Method". I have audited
(taken as non-credit) a Post Graduate course on algorithms titled
"Current Topics in Theory and Algorithms" and I have currently taken
another elective on the Design and analysis of algorithms. I have also
done a course on Geometric Algorithms which gave me a good exposure to
Randomization in algorithms. I am confident that these and the other
courses I have done will stand in good stead in any future research I
undertake.

	I have always loved solving problems. The pleasure obtained
from being absorbed in problems over extended periods of time and
finally arriving at solutions is immeasurable. Many times I have
arrived at solutions that were very different from those of others.
This unique bent of mind coupled with a desire to be at the forefront
of a budding field drive me to pursue research. I believe myself to
be mature, committed

	I have good reason to believe that I will be successful as a
teacher. I have received enthusiastic response from my students when I
was a course assistant in an undergraduate course titled "Computer
Programming and Utilization". I have also been a lecturer and tutor in
two UNIX workshops conducted by our department at the institute
level. Further, I believe that teaching a subject gives us greater
insight into it.

	I have chosen to pursue Graduate studies at New York
University because the facilities there seem to foster a healthy
research environment as I could gather from the brochure of your
department. 

I believe that I possess  the  motivation,  the  intellectual 
ability, and the preparation to  set  out  on  this  exhilarating  and 
arduous path, to do justice to a demanding Graduate program and to make 
significant contributions to the ongoing work at the Kansas State University.

\centerline {\Large  STATEMENT  OF PURPOSE}
\vspace{0.5in}

I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of
Technology (I.I.T.), Bombay. I wish to pursue a career in research in 
Computer Science. I would like to embark upon this venture through the 
Doctoral Program offered by the Department of Computer Science at Rice
University. 

My deep interest in Computer Science stems from a natural aptitude for logic
and mathematics, the ``queen of sciences''. I consider Computer Science not 
just as a field to pursue a research career in, but as a
hobby. Throughout  my undergraduate study, I have endeavoured to gain a
broad  perspective of Computer Science. My fields of interest range
over a wide spectrum of areas; however I am especially fascinated by
Programming Languages, Real-Time Systems and Parallel Processing.

My training at I.I.T., Bombay has not only equipped me with a strong
technical base but has also instilled in me a deep interest in
research.  During the course of my B.Tech. curriculum, I have presented a
seminar titled {\bf ``Selected Topics in Advanced Architectures''} under the 
guidance of Prof. S.S.S.P. Rao. During the summer of 1994, I had the rare
opportunity of working at {\bf Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
(B.A.R.C.)} , Bombay, a forerunner of Parallel Processing in
India. The training at B.A.R.C. has  demonstrated to me how emerging
technology when combined with ingenuity can be employed to solve
apparently diverse problems in Physics and Medicine. I am currently
working on my B.Tech. project titled {\bf``Statechart Simulation Using
Binary Decision Diagrams''} under the guidance of Dr. S. Ramesh. Despite the
intense competition at I.I.T., I have been  consistent in  my
performance; with a Cumulative Points Index of {\bf 8.83} I stand $9^{th}$
in a class of 33 students. 

Study in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at I.I.T., Bombay has demanded long hours of continuous work, self-motivated efforts and a
considerable amount of group activity. It has given me several
opportunities to participate in various departmental activities,
albeit in a small way. Learning by myself and sharing my knowledge
with others has always been of prime importance to me. I have limited
teaching  experience from tutoring an elementary course on FORTRAN-77 for
students of first year B.Tech. program. I enjoyed the experience and
would  like to teach in future too.

I look upon graduate study as an avenue to refine my skills and give
a direction to my research career. It would be my first chance to make
fundamental contribution to the field in which I undertake research. 
The excellent research facilities at Rice University and the distinguished
faculty are a great source of inspiration to me. The emphasis on 
multidisciplinary  seminars and research projects would definitely
encourage me to  explore other related areas within the realms of
Computer Science.

I hope I fit in with your expectations of a promising graduate student.
Admission to the Department of Computer Science at Rice University
could well be that golden foundation upon which the entire edifice of my
scientific career rests.

\title{Statement of Purpose}
\date{}
\author{ }
\maketitle

After carefully considering my aptitude, interests, the nature of my training
and my ultimate professional ambition, I have decided to pursue Ph. D. in
electrical engineering specialising in the fields of my interest namely-
Communications, Signal Processing and Information Theory and Coding,
ultimately leading to a career in teaching and research. As a 
statement of purpose of my graduate study, I describe here my academic
background, my research interests and my career goals.   

 
The undergraduate programme at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay is a
well rounded programme. It not only helped me build a solid foundation of
Electrical Engineering fundamentals, but also helped me develop an overall
perspective of the vast field of Electrical Engineering. In the final year I
developed a keen interest in the areas of Communications and Signal
Processing. I substantiated my knowledge of these areas by choosing electives
on Digital Communications, Communication System Theory (Random Processes in
Communications), Digital Signal Processing and Information Theory and Coding. 

In the Master of Technology Programme, I specialised in Communications. 
Taking advantage of a fully flexible course structure, I have chosen
electives on Statistical Signal Analysis, Applied Linear Algebra in
Electrical Engineering, Theory of Error Correcting Codes, Image Processing
and Adaptive Signal Processing. Apart from these, I have taken courses on two
special topics in Electrical Engineering namely- Computational  Vision and
Artificial Neural Networks. 

 I have striven to perform well in the courses and have tried to gain
 as much  as I could from them. But I feel that the real qualification 
 of a good graduate student is his ability to perform independent research 
 work under the guidance of an advisor.  My B.Tech. (final year) project
 under Prof. P. G. Poonacha  gave me such an opportunity. In my B. Tech.
 project I studied convergence issues in Non-Symmetrical and Higher order
 Neural Networks . First part of the project has been submitted to 
 IEEE Trans. Neural Networks as a brief paper. It has been accepted after
 review.
 	
 In my M.Tech Programme, I did a mini project on determination of rotation
 parameters of a lamina from its binary images using moment-invariants
 of the images. I did an intensive seminar (a survey of literature) on
 Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Optimisation. 
  
My M.Tech. thesis deals with Information across Boolean Functions. It
involves establishing relationship between complexity measures of Boolean
 Functions and an attempt to study the nature of optimal circuit through 
 restrictions of a Boolean function. 

 The project work and the course work have further interested me in
Communication and Signal Processing and have motivated me to learn more of
these areas.  Also, the ideas involved in finding fundamental limits on
capabilities of information extraction and transmission and the attempts at
achieving the limits - which form the core of information theory - have
interested me very much.  I realise that techniques and the tools used there
overlap. Therefore I have taken liberty to quote these broad areas as
research interests. Specifically the areas of my interest are Source Coding/
 Data Compression,  Information Theory and Coding, Statistical Signal Processing,
Digital Communication, 
 Multi-user Communication,
optimal filtering and detection and estimation.
I am also interested in the application of Neural Networks
to these areas. 

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCSB is  a well known 
center of excellence.  The department faculty consists of leading researchers    
engaged in frontline research. The research interests of the faculty are extremely 
compatible with those of mine, a fact underlined by the fact that some of 
the faculty members are pioneering people in their fields. In particular,
I would like to work with  the faculty involved with the Center for Information 
Processing and Research. I shall be glad to be a part of the group and witness 
and contribute my bit to the leading research being carried out at UCSB.
An opportunity to work in the stimulating environment at UCSB will certainly
make the graduate study a rewarding exercise and a satisfying experience.
In terms of research facilities also, a university like UCSB has more to offer to 
a graduate student. 
 I, therefore, look forward to joining UCSB as a graduate student.   
    
                                          
As professional goal, I would like to  take up a career in  research and teaching.    
>From the residential system of IIT Bombay, I have been able to have a glimpse
of the academic life and the sacrifices it involves. I feel that it is this
kind of life that I am best suited for. I feel that I have enough           
motivation to see me through the challenges of the arduous but exhilarating 
career in research.

I thank Prof. Gersho and Prof. Rose for their advice and valuable information.

                   Statement of Purpose


Long Term Goals

My undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science and En-
gineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay has exposed me to
a stimulating academic environment where learning and research go hand-in-
hand.  Through the many opportunities I have had here, I have found that I
have a deep interest in research work and a strong aptitude for the type of pro*
 *b-
lem solving and problem discovery that it involves. I have, therefore decided to
pursue active research in Computer Science as a career.


Areas of Interest

Of the many fields in the Computer Science spectrum, I am interested in com-
puter systems. In particular, I am interested in Databases.


Immediate Goals

I plan to work towards a Ph. D. with a focus on Databases. I would also like
to follow up my interests in Computer Systems through my course work. I feel
that this should be my next step on my road to a research career in Computer
Science. I would be most willing to work directly for a Ph.D. if it is possible.
However, I would be willing to do M.S. as a first step towards obtaining my
Ph.D.


Academic Background

Throughout 12 years of schooling, I had always been among the top ranking
students in the class. I was ranked 47th out of 80,000 students (99.94%ile) in
the national level entrance examinations to the IITs. I was ranked 2nd in the
state level entrance examinations for the state engineering colleges. Currently
with G.P.A. of 9.00 on scale of 10.00, I am among the top 5% of the students of
my batch in the Institute. This high level of consistency in my academic record
makes me feel confident enough to hold my own againgst the very best.


Preparation for Graduate Study

My undergraduate preparation at the Computer Science and Engineering De-
partment of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay has given me a very
substantial knowledge of the basic areas of Computer Science.
Any amount of learning in Computer Science would be incomplete without
hands on experience of Programming.In this regard I completed various mini
projects both out my own interest and also as a part of some of my courses



My senior year dissertation under Dr. S.Seshadri ( Ph.D. Wisconsin Madi-
son ) is titled B+ -Tree Concurrency Control Algorithms in Real-time environ-
ment.  Operations on B+ -Tree are crucial while maximizing concurrency in a
Database System. In real-time environment in which each such operation has
associated deadline it is more crucial. There are specialized algorithms for the
purpose.  As a part of the project, I will be doing performance evaluation of
these algorithms.
To considate my knowledge in my field of interest, I had credited the course
Advances in Database Technology in the fall semester. The course involved
the study of various classic papers in Databases. I presented a seminar on Main
Memory Databases as a part of the course. I am also crediting a course on
Distributed Databases in the Spring semester. I am also an active member
of SIGDB ( Special Interest Group in Databases ) of the institute, which keeps
me fully informed about the latest development in Databases. I have presented
some latest papers during its meetings.



Teaching Experience

I was a teaching assistant for the fresher's course CS101: Computer Pro-
gramming and Utilization during Fall 93. I was also an organiser during unix
workshops and C language workshop conducted by students of our department.
This has made me confident that I will prove to be a very good teacher.


Reasons for selecting University of Wisconsin

Your university is considered to be one of the best universities in databases
research. Your faculty has distinguised researchers in the field of databases. I
am also familiar with some of the research papers published by them. My guide
Dr.S.Seshadri, an alumnus of your university has encouraged me to apply here.
As a result, I am very enthusiastic about joining your university for graduate
studies.


Summing Up

I am aware of the hard work and perseverence necessary for research work
and I know that it is not always as exciting as the published results
seem to indicate. Nevertheless, I am sure that my aptitude and drive
will see me through the challenge. Looking forward to joining University
of Wisconsin at Madison.

{\Large \bf Statement of Purpose}
\end{center}

I was first introduced to computers through the elementary programming
courses in my school days. In my high school I took Computer Science
as an additional subject. This fascination for computers lead me to
the {\bf Department of Computer Science and Engineering} at the {\bf Indian
Institute of Technology, Bombay}, one of India's foremost educational
institutes. The course structure, a good balance of theory and
programming laboratories, and excellent faculty introduced me to the
stimulating field of research. I got a complete exposure to the core
fields of Computer Science and Mathematics. I started to enjoy the
problem solving techniques and appreciate the pleasure of success
after endless hours of frustrating work. All this has lead me to
decide on a career of research and academics. 

\

Ten years from now I envisage myself doing active academic research in
a good university. I believe that teaching a subject is the best way
of learning the subject. Hence my immediate goal is to enter the
Ph. D. program at {\bf Indiana University}.

\

My main fields of interest are {\bf Distributed Systems, Real Time Systems
and Concurrent Programming Languages}. Presently I am doing my B. Tech
project under Dr. S. Ramesh on implementation of the Communicating
Reactive Processes(CRP) model. In the first stage of the project I
have studied the various distributed algorithms for Communicating
Sequential Processes implementation and other related fairness
issues. An impossibility result regarding the problem has been proved
and an algorithm has been proposed. I am planning to shape this into a
journal paper. 

\

As part of the Operating Systems course I did a study of the Group
Communication protocols in the Amoeba Distributed Operating
System. Next semester I am crediting a post-graduate
elective---Foundations of Parallel Computation. I am a student
member of the IEEE computer society. I am also interested in Computer
Architecture and had presented a home paper on the 6811 Motorola
microcontroller. 

\

My decision to apply to {\bf Indiana University} is based on a careful
examination of the department brochure, world wide web information and
talking to my guide Dr. S. Ramesh. Indiana has a strong faculty in Programming
Language Design. Entering the Ph. D. program here will be ideal for me.

\

My academic record reflects that I have always been a consistent
performer. In school I was always in the top five of the class and in
the Secondary Certificate Examination I stood second in my school. I
secured 126th rank in the All India Joint Entrance Examination for
IIT. At the end of my first year I was ranked 10th in the
institute. After seven semesters I have a CGPA of 8.83/10.00 and I am
in the top ten of my class.

\

I have been a tutor for a first year introductory course in
Computers. This involved guidance of the students in the programming
assignments and correction of papers. I enjoyed the experience and
would love to teach. I also have been an organizer in UNIX workshops
held in our department. 

\

I am a hardworking, steady and quiet person. My final aim is to be
blissfully involved in Distributed Systems and Programming
Languages. I hope I can join {\bf Indiana University} and achieve my dream.

Imp points to note:

0. Read the following BEFORE READING THE SOP.
1. I have given this to many students.
2. If two sops to a univ should never have anything in common.
(this may be considered as cheating)
3. See that not many students use the exact contents
(sentences) in their sops (uniqueness and individuality are
important aspects of a sop).
4. V. IMP - make a sincere attempt of writin a sop or at least
the points BEFORE U READ THIS (and get biased).
5. I would not consider this sop as the best possible (it is
slightly high-sounding). Many succesful people consider frank
and simple sops as ideal.
6. Reflect your personality and inclination in the sop.
0. A good sop is a v. imp. determinant.

hope it helps
all the best

                Statement of Purpose

My objective for graduate  studies  in  Computer  Science  is  to
prepare  myself  for  the  long term goal of pursuing a career of
teaching and research. 
I have  nurtured  a  strong  passion  to
become  a  scientist  and  pursue  research.  In  the  pursuit of
knowledge , I have always adopted a rigorous approach in order to
attain  an in-depth understanding of the subject at hand.This has
amply  reflected  in  my  consistently  brilliant   career,always
topping  the  class  and  having received numerous national level
awards.With a GPA of 9.72 , I am ranked first at  the  IIT  among
nearly 350 students. 


I have been involved in  research  in  parallel  and  distributed
computing  systems.I  studied  various  problems  in  distributed
systems and distributed databases  including  deadlock  detection
and  resolution  ,  termination detection , distributed snapshots
and consistency.I  have  been  attracted  towards  the  field  of
correctness  of parallel programs. I published a Technical Report
reporting errors in two published deadlock  detection  algorithms
and  highlights their underlying deficiencies with respect to the
distributed nature of computation.  I am  also  involved  in  the
development  of  an  optimizer generator which would automate the
process of writing optimizers based on the specifications of  the
optimizations.I  am  currently  engaged  in writing a paper on an
efficient algorithm for performing global data-flow analysis. The
new  algorithm  that  I  have  developed  utilizes  the notion of
backward information flow to perform propagation using work-lists
in  an  efficient  manner.  I  have  been  in correspondence with
Professor J.D.Ullman about my algorithm and other aspects of  the
problem.


I have chosen to pursue graduate studies at  Stanford  University
because  by  working  under  the  guidance  of  the distinguished
researchers I am confident of making an original contribution  in
the  field  of  Computer  Science.  My  interest  in research has
burgeoned during my undergraduate studies at IIT. I have excelled
in  our  the well-rounded  and exacting undergraduate program and
have developed a solid background to take up research in Computer
Science.             

I have decided to go in for graduate studies which  calls  for  a
personal  commitment   to  the  fulfilling  craft  of independent
research and that involves willingly making  personal  sacrifices
of time , leisure and immediate reward  .  In  turn  I shall  get
intellectual  satisfaction  and  the gratification of becoming  a
contributor  to   knowledge   through  research  and  the greater
personal rewards of  learning  and  discovery.I  believe  that  I
possess  the  motivation, intellectual ability and preparation to
set  out  on  this  exhiliarating  and  arduous  path and to make
significant original  contributions  to  your  on-going  research
work.


I look  forward  to  joining Stanford University as  a  graduate
student at your esteemed department.

\chapter* {personal statement}


I, Rakesh Barve, am in the final year of the four year {\it Bachelor of
Technology} program  of the {\it Computer Science and Engineering} 
program of the {\it Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay}.My career
objectives lie in the pursuance of research and academics in theoretical
computer science - especially in {\bf mathematical logic, automated 
theorem proving,program correctness and semantics of programming
languages}.I believe that graduate studies leading to a {\bf Ph.D}
through research work of quality in these fields are a necessary step 
towards my goal.


The undergraduate courses of the CSE department of IIT have given me a 
comprehensive exposure to all the core fields of computer science and 
mathematics.Man's attempts at mathematically modelling objects of study
and then using these models to reason, predict, draw new meanings and 
interpretations have always fascinated me. Hence , in course of my 
studies I've come to realize that I wish to pursue research and
academics in the above mentioned areas of theorotical computer science.
These areas, I believe are rapidly developing and offer great scope to
one who is confident of producing fruitful work and coming up with 
creative ideas.


I have performed reasonably well in my undergraduate courses at IIT,but
since IIT admits only the best students throughout the country, I 
believe ,in view of the competitive atmosphere, that the grades secured
should not be considered in an absolute sense.


My interest in theoretical computer science has inspired me to carry out
research and implementation in this subject, as can be seen from my 
attached resume. Simultaneously , I have kept myself abreast with the 
recent trends in research through literature surveys during projects,
related to courses and otherwise. I have availed of every oppurtinity to
learn more about my areas of interest. I have taken/have enrolled for a
number of relevant courses offered by the computer science,mathematics
and humanities departments. My senior thesis (home paper) {\bf PROGRAM
VERIFICATION USING ALGEBRAIC METHODS} has given me a chance to explore
these areas in greater depth (details in resume).All these activities
have gone a long way towards making my background very strong in my 
areas of interest.


I have also had a good deal of teaching experience as can be seen from
attached certificates. This experience convinced that I have the 
communication skills and the ability to explain things precisely to
become a teacher.


My years at IIT have been enlightening ones but I need to constructively
build up on what I've learned so far. {\bf Duke} ,I think is the ideal
learned so far.Duke, I think, is an ideal choice towards this end.My 
decision was based on a careful examination of the department brochures
and information from faculty members and alumni. I have also 
communicated with Dr.Henry Greenside ,Director of graduate studies of
the Computer Science department.


Duke has a stress on research-oriented study, flexibility and closer
Professor-student relationships. I think that having such a sound
academic environment at a reputed University such as Duke, with the work
of a small group of teachers serving as a model, I will be able to 
attain my true potential. Specifically I am keen to participate in the 
ongoing research activity at Duke in the following fields:

\begin {itemise}
 {\item Finding efficient proof procedures for first order logic theorem
 proving.}
 {\item Reasoning in equational logics}
 {\item Program correctness and program transformation}
 \end {itemise}


 I look forward to making my contributions to the advancement of
 computer science - starting at Duke.

\centerline{ \Large Statement of Purpose}
\vspace{1cm}

My undergraduate studies in the department of computer Science and
Engg at IIT Bombay have exposed me to a stimulating academic
environment where learning and research go together. Through the many
opportunities I have had here. I have grown to love research work and
have found that I have a strong aptitude for the kind of work that it
involves. I have therefore decided to pursue active research as a
career. It is with this objective in mind that I wish to enroll for
the doctoral program in your university. 

\

I plan to study at the graduate level in the area of distributed
computing, specifically the theory of asynchronous systems. I believe
that theory and application in Computer Science go hand-in-hand. The
study of theoretical aspects of distributed systems is essential for
the successful development of applications for heterogeneous and
fault-tolerant systems. The possibilities of research in this field 
fascinate me. 

\

Recent research in the theory of asynchronous computation has yielded
theorems describing the computability of tasks in asynchronous systems
that can tolerate multiple failures. Attempts are also being made to
completely characterize the power of various synchronization
primitives in an asynchronous system. As part of my B.Tech project
(senior thesis) under Dr.~S.~Ramesh I am currently working on
extending these results to stronger synchronization primitives and
exploring the possibility of utilizing some of these ideas to
completely describe the power of concurrent objects. To further my
understanding of these problems I have also enrolled myself for the
graduate level course, {\em Foundations of Parallel Computation} under
Dr.~Ranade.

\

I have excelled in academics at every step in my education. Throughout
twelve years of schooling I have always been ranked among the top of
my class. I was introduced to Computer Science in junior college. I
was awarded the Merit Certificate for my performance in the All India
Senior School Certificate Examination - {\bf 100\%} in Computer
Science, {\bf 99\%} in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. I was also
placed seventh in the state wide Physics Talent Test of the Physics
Society, Madras. In the highly competitive entrance examination to the
IITs I was ranked 134th among over 100,000 students. The broad
curriculum at IIT Bombay provided me with a strong foundation in all
branches of Computer Science. Of these I have pursued those which have
particularly appealed to me. During the summer of 1994, I worked on a
`learning' program for the game {\em Othello} using Neural Nets that I
had initially developed as part of my course work. For my seminar
(junior thesis) I studied {\em smart recompilation and incremental
parsing techniques} under Dr.~Dhamdhare. Efficient implementation of
these techniques can substantially reduce compilation time in large
software systems.

\

I have also gained considerable teaching experience in IIT. I have
been a course assistant for the Institute level freshman course,
Computer Programming and Utilization for two consecutive years. I have
also delivered lectures and given demonstrations on UNIX at various
workshops conducted by the Computer Science and Engg. Association. All
of these have been well received and have made me confident of
developing into a very good teacher (I have also taken the Test for
Spoken English in November 1995). I have worked for two months at
ARCUS, Bangalore, a company that develops VLSI tools and also for
Rational, USA at their third party development centre in Bangalore.

\

My undergraduate program has given me sufficient exposure to various
avenues for research and I have chosen Distributed Computing for
which I have both an aptitude and a liking.  A good graduate program
is now essential for gaining a deeper insight and to make significant
original contributions to this field. I am confident that I possess the
motivation, intellectual ability and preparation to succeed in a
demanding graduate program.

\

My interest in the theory of distributed computing makes UCLA a
natural choice for graduate study.  Professor Eliezer Gafni is one of
the leading researchers in this field and I have studied his work as
part of my ongoing thesis and he has encouraged me to apply to your
program.  Working under an expert whose work can serve as a model will
set me on the path to contributing significantly to the ongoing
research at UCLA.  The research interests of the other faculty members
cover a large number of topics in Computer Science and this will
enable me to keep in touch with the latest developments in these
fields. The excellent facilities offered by your department will
provide an environment conducive to successful graduate work. The
faculty at IIT have also strongly recommended UCLA for pursuing
graduate studies.

\

I look forward to joining UCLA as a graduate student at your esteemed
department.
