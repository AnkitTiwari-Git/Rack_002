	Statement of Purpose
}
\end{center}


 I, Punit Bhargava, am a final year student of the four year Bachelor 
of Techonology (B.Tech.) program in Computer Science \& Engineering at 
the Indian Institute Of Techonology (IIT),  one of the nation's 
premier institutes. My long term career objective is to pursue a 
research career, either as a faculty in a university or a researcher in
industry and Graduate Study at your department would be the  first step towards this
goal.


  Since childhood I have had a strong inclination towards science. My excellent performance in academics inspired me to take up science as a career. 
I therefore, took the  Joint  Entrance  Examination  for   admission to 
the IITs and qualified in  the  top 0.12% of about 150,000 who took the 
test.

%I
           The excellent course structure coupled  with  high academic 
standard further stimulated my interest in scientific pursuit. My 
approach  towards  courses  was  to  grasp the basic concepts so as to 
develop a 'feel' for the subject. My grades reflect my attitude towards
courses. As a part  of  curriculum  I  actively  participated  in many 
innovative projects. As a result I have developed a keen interest and  have a sufficient aptitude for 
research and therefore I believe that I shall be  capable of meeting the best standards in research. 

%Interest
Over  the  past  two  years  in  the  Computer Science 
department, I have developed a keen  interest in  Programming Languages
and Distributed \& Parallel Systems. I have taken many courses related 
to this  field and have done cosistantly well in them. Courses such as
 Programming Languages, Language Processors (Compilers), Operating 
Systems 
have given me considerable exposure to this field.
I am taking a Graduate level Course on Parallel Algorithms next semester. 

%Btp
Currently I am involved in  my B.Tech. Project on ``Program Restructuring for GENSAT'' under the guidance of Dr. D.M. Dhamdhere. Details of the project
are given in my resume. Presently I am implementing an algorithm by 
Zahira Ammargulleat. I have proposed a few changes in her algorithm and 
have proved that the new algorithm would do better than the one proposed
by her, in all the cases. 


A good deal of teaching experience, as seen in my resume, makes me 
confident of my ability to communicate as a teacher.

%univ
%Computer Science at UIUC is one of the best programs to pursue research in the field of
%systems. 

>From the information brochure, web pages and as advised by my 
 guide, Dr. Dhamdhere , I have gathered that a considerable amount of research is being 
done in Systems in UIUC. A number of renowned faculty members of UIUC
are working on the research frontiers of computer science. It would be 
my privelige to work with such renowned researchers, and contribute something
useful to Computer Science.


%Conclusion
 
  I look forward to joing UIUC as a Graduate student at your esteemed
department.
