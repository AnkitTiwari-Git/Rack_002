\ \\
{\Large {\bf My goals}}\\

	I, Ashwin Shrinivas, am applying to the University of
Washington, Seattle for admission to the Ph.D. program in Computer
Science. My goal is to pursue a career in research, either in industry
or in academia. Ten years from now, I envisage myself as a full-fledged
research professional in an organization, or a faculty member at one of
the leading universities. A Ph.D. is an important first step in
achieving this objective.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My background}}\\

Though I was exposed to some aspects of Computer Science in my
last two years of school, a comprehensive foundation in all the fields
of Computer Science began after I entered IIT Bombay. The Computer
Science department at IIT Bombay is indisputably among the best in the 
country. Its excellent courses, faculty and learning environment have
given me a firm grounding in all the fields of Computer Science.

My academic and co-curricular record has been consistently good.
Throughout school as well as now, I have been at or near the top of my
class. My class at IIT Bombay consists of 36 students, chosen from an
All India exam involving 100,000 students. I myself was $9^{th}$ in that
exam. I have listed some of my achievements on the attached resum\'{e}.

I am of the opinion that research requires a firm grounding in theory
backed up by an in-depth knowledge of systems and implementation. The
important courses of {\em Discrete Structures}, {\em Data Structures \&
Algorithms}, and {\em Theory of Computation} have given me a good
knowledge of theory. In addition, I am doing the course {\em Design \&
Analysis of Algorithms} this semester and {\em Parallel Algorithms} next
semester, in order to further firm up my foundations. My performance in
lab courses attests to my knowledge of systems and programming.

My strengths are my consistency, capacity for hard work, and my ability
to work in a team. I have been involved in many course projects which
involved a group of students, and I have been the team leader in quite
a few of these. I believe that research involves new ideas, as well as
consistent effort to back them up, both of which I am capable of.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My primary interests}}\\

I prefer research problems to be an ideal mix of theory and practice.
The field of {\bf Databases} interests me because of the scope for
breaking new ground, as well as the vast applications possible. I
believe that {\bf Distributed Databases}, in particular, is an area
with a lot of potential. My grounding in this field is solid, which is
reflected in my obtaining the best possible grade in both the courses
involving Databases, namely, {\em Business Information Systems} and
{\em Database Management Systems}, and in their respective labs too.
Currently, I am working on my Senior Thesis under Dr. S. Seshadri,
in which we are looking at the problem of {\em Garbage Collection in
Persistent Object Stores}. We plan to submit it for publication after
running some performance tests, which we are designing. I have included
details in my resum\'{e}.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf Why Washington-Seattle ?}}\\

Since all fields in Computer Science are highly interlinked, I want to
pursue graduate studies at a University that is strong in all fields of
Computer Science. I am aware that the department of Computer Science at
the University of Washington, Seattle is one of the best in the world,
being particularly strong in Databases (my primary interest).
Dr. Seshadri also recommends it highly. These facts have led me to apply
to Washington-Seattle.

There is one more ({\em and the most compelling}) reason. In the course
of my Senior Thesis, I have come across related work by
Dr. L. Shapiro. Her work has interested me immensely, and I would
like to participate in some of the projects she is undertaking.
Subsequently I corresponded with Dr. Shapiro, and her encouraging
reply and description of the work at the department reinforced my
decision to apply.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf Financial Aid}}\\

I would be fully dependent on aid to finance my graduate studies. If I
am granted an assistantship, then given my long term goals, a research
assistantship would be an ideal experience for me. I have already 
mentioned my interest in research. I also have some
experience in teaching. I have been a lecturer \& demonstrator in
student workshops held in various colleges in the region. I was also
involved in a nationwide program which involved teaching school
children. The good response to my efforts, coupled with my prowess in
dramatics, elocution \& debating gives me the confidence to handle any
teaching assignment.

\ \\
{\Large {\bf My plans if admitted}}\\

I plan to carry on advanced study of Databases, as well as related
fields (e.g. Algorithms), not only through coursework but also by
{\em participating in one of the several ongoing projects}.
This will also give me the opportunity to contribute my bit to the
understanding of the fields which interest me so much.

I am aware that the University of Washington, Seattle expects very high
standards from its students. My track record gives me the confidence
that I will be able to meet those expectations. I believe that my
association with the Computer Science department will be a mutually
profitable one.
